# Neuromancer ADHD Phenomenology: Research Tasks

## Project Status

**Phase 1: COMPLETE** ✓
**Phase 2: READY TO EXECUTE**
**Phase 3: Pending (Track C preparation)**

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR AGENTS

**DO NOT open the `synthesis-notes/` folder.**

That folder contains pre-formed conclusions that will contaminate your close reading. Execute Phase 2 tasks using only:
- The novel (*Neuromancer*)
- The completed Phase 1 findings (below)
- The task instructions in this folder

The quarantine lifts only after all Phase 2 tasks are complete.

---

## Overview

This folder contains eight standalone research tasks supporting the essay project: **"Before the Words Existed: Neuromancer and the Phenomenology of Cognitive Mismatch"**

Each task is designed to be executed independently by a human researcher or LLM research agent. Tasks are modular but build cumulatively.

---

## Phase 1 Findings (Validated — Use These)

### Task 1.1: Deprivation State — VERIFIED WITH QUALIFICATIONS

**Core claims validated:**
- Body-as-luggage: STRONG (E16-E18)
- Purposeless alertness: STRONG (E07-E09)
- Tractionlessness: STRONG (E10-E12)
- Temporal accumulation: STRONG (E13-E15)
- World-as-noise: SUPPORTED (E04-E06)
- Affective flatness: QUALIFIED — "attritional flattening punctuated by spikes," not total numbness

**Counterexamples documented (must acknowledge in essay):**
- 1.1-X01: Tactical calculation about Wage
- 1.1-X02: Sharp observational inference about sarariman implants
- 1.1-X03: Decisive action ("Time to see old Julie")

**Noir discriminants:**
- Reversibility: Leans mismatch (deprivation framed as contingent/curable)
- Relationality: Mixed but mismatch-leaning (failure framed as fit, not essence)

**Two-layer model validated:** Noir is atmosphere; mismatch is mechanism.

---

### Task 1.2: Sharp Memory — VERIFIED WITH QUALIFICATIONS

**Core claims validated:**
- Memory is procedurally precise: STRONG (E01-E05)
- Prose texture tightens for Matrix passages: VERIFIED
- Phantom-limb structure: DEFENSIBLE ("trying to reach the console that wasn't there")
- Loss framed as severance, not decay: SUPPORTED

**Qualifications:**
- Affective tone is mixed, not purely cold
- Occasional elegiac phrasing ("bodiless exultation," "the Fall") must be acknowledged
- Distinguish cognitive precision from emotional coldness

**Precision discriminant:** Strong mismatch signal — procedural specificity exceeds noir mood alone.

**Counter-evidence absorbed:**
- "Hope fading nightly" = affective erosion, not cognitive degradation
- Elegiac diction ("Fall") = mythic framing layered over operational memory

---

## Methodological Posture

This analysis does not claim perceptual neutrality. It begins from recognition: the experience of reading *Neuromancer* and finding something that resonates with contemporary accounts of cognitive-environment mismatch. This recognition names a point of entry, not a governing explanation.

The lens is not "ADHD as diagnostic category" but "mismatch as experiential structure": a pattern that must be rendered in the text itself to hold. The structure is testable. If the deprivation state shows engagement rather than flatness, if memory degrades rather than sharpens, if restoration reads as intoxication rather than homecoming, the reading fails.

The discipline lies in testing, not in pretending to see from nowhere.

## The Noir Problem (Critical Context)

A competent SF/noir critic will object: "This is just genre-conventional alienation. You're redescribing what cyberpunk does."

This objection is serious. The research must not only verify phenomenological claims but also **test whether they exceed generic noir/cyberpunk alienation**.

**Two-layer model:**
- **Noir** names the atmosphere (political economy, genre affect, existential mood)
- **Mismatch** names the mechanism of subjectivity within that atmosphere

These can coexist. The claim is not "Neuromancer depicts alienation." The claim is: it depicts a *reversible, interface-dependent reconfiguration of cognition* with features that exceed generic genre mood.

**Three discriminants distinguish mismatch from noir:**

| Discriminant | Noir Pattern | Mismatch Pattern | Phase 1 Result |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Reversibility** | Competence spikes are aesthetic flashes inside persistent futility | Interface-state produces qualitatively different cognition | ✓ Mismatch |
| **Precision** | Longing is nostalgic, mythic, symbolic | Relation to access is procedurally exact (phantom-limb structure) | ✓ Mismatch |
| **Relationality** | Alienation is existential, persists across contexts | Mismatch is relational: appears when environment denies conditions for competence | ✓ Mixed/Mismatch |

## Task Index

### Phase 1: Validation — COMPLETE ✓

| Task | Title | Status | Key Finding |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| **1.1** | Verify Deprivation State | ✓ COMPLETE | Validated with qualifications; two-layer model holds |
| **1.2** | Verify Sharp Memory | ✓ COMPLETE | Phantom-limb structure validated; precision discriminant satisfied |

### Phase 2: Evidence Gathering — READY TO EXECUTE

| Task | Title | Purpose | Key Tests | Status |
|------|-------|---------|-----------|--------|
| **2.1** | Time Phenomenology | Map temporal experience shifts across states | Time distortion patterns + ADHD resonance points | Ready |
| **2.2** | Addiction Framing | Test "institutional misdescription" thesis | Speaker attribution + Experience vs. label mismatch | Ready |
| **2.3** | Environmental Markers | Test oscillation between medical/interactional framings | Attribution inventory + Functional logic assessment | Ready |

**Phase 2 tasks can run in parallel.** All depend on Phase 1 findings (above).

## Evidence Logging System

**Use consistently across all tasks:**

### Evidence IDs
Format: `[Task]-E[Number]` (e.g., `1.1-E01`, `1.2-E03`, `2.2-E12`)
- Counterexamples use `X` instead of `E` (e.g., `1.1-X01`)
- This enables cross-task synthesis and citation

### Voice Channel
Tag every piece of evidence:
- **N** = Narrator (direct description)
- **FI** = Free indirect discourse (inhabiting Case's perspective)
- **D** = Dialogue (other characters speaking)

**Weight:** N and FI are strong evidence. D is weaker (reflects speaker's framework, not necessarily Case's experience). Patterns across multiple N/FI passages are strongest.

---

## Defensive Positions (Pre-Established)

The research framework has been stress-tested against three hostile reviewer positions:

### Reviewer #1: SF Formalist ("This is just noir")
**Established defense:** The two-layer model. Noir is atmosphere; mismatch is mechanism. Phase 1 validated this distinction.

### Reviewer #2: Disability Studies Skeptic ("You're romanticising impairment")
**Established defense:** Acknowledge oscillation. The text uses damage language *and* access language. Task 2.3 gathers evidence for both framings. The claim is that *functional logic* resolves toward access.

### Reviewer #3: Phenomenology Purist ("Your bracketing fails")
**Established defense:** Recognition initiates inquiry but doesn't adjudicate findings. The lens is "mismatch as structure," not "ADHD as diagnosis." Discipline lies in testing. All tasks include explicit falsification criteria.

## ⛔ Quarantine Rules

The `synthesis-notes/` folder contains:

1. **cybernetics-wintermute-analysis.md** — Systems theory interpretation
2. **essay-draft-unverified.md** — Pre-formed essay draft

**These documents will contaminate your evidence gathering.**

They contain conclusions derived from secondary sources, not primary textual verification. Reading them before completing Phase 2 guarantees confirmation bias.

**Quarantine lifts when:**
- [ ] Task 2.1 complete
- [ ] Task 2.2 complete
- [ ] Task 2.3 complete

---

## Common Standards Across All Tasks

### Evidence Requirements
- Quote accurately or paraphrase closely
- Note page/chapter locations
- Distinguish explicit text from inference
- Include counter-evidence

### Counter-Reading Requirement
Each task requires engaging the strongest objection to the reading.

### Deliverables
Each task specifies concrete outputs:
- Evidence tables
- Pattern summaries (word counts specified)
- Implications for draft (specific, actionable)

### Quality Threshold
Tasks are complete only when completion criteria checklist is satisfied.
