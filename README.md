## Overview

This folder contains eight standalone research tasks supporting the essay project: **"Before the Words Existed: Neuromancer and the Phenomenology of Cognitive Mismatch"**

Each task is designed to be executed independently by a human researcher or LLM research agent. Tasks are modular but build cumulatively.

---

## Phase 1 Findings (Validated — Use These)

### Task 1.1: Deprivation State — VERIFIED WITH QUALIFICATIONS (25 entries + 4 counter)

**Core claims validated:**
- Body-as-luggage: STRONG (E16-E18, E20, E25)
- Purposeless alertness: STRONG (E07-E09, E21)
- Tractionlessness: STRONG (E10-E12, E22)
- Temporal accumulation: STRONG (E13-E15, E24)
- World-as-noise: SUPPORTED (E04-E06)
- Affective flatness: QUALIFIED — "attritional flattening punctuated by spikes," not total numbness (E19, E23 deepen this)

**Second-pass additions (Ch.2, 4, 12, 17):**
- E19: Later recall affirms long-term flatness ("Numb... He'd been numb a long time")
- E20-E23: Arena pre-restoration echoes deprivation profile
- E24: Straylight temporal repetition outside Chiba
- E25: Simstim body as excess input

**Counterexamples documented (must acknowledge in essay):**
- 1.1-X01: Tactical calculation about Wage
- 1.1-X02: Sharp observational inference about sarariman implants
- 1.1-X03: Decisive action ("Time to see old Julie")
- 1.1-X04: Future-pull anticipation ("Seven days and he'd jack in")

**Second-pass finding:** Patterns did not shift; they deepened. Later chapters echo the deprivation profile while reinforcing the need to qualify flatness with intermittent future-pull.

**Noir discriminants:**
- Reversibility: Leans mismatch (deprivation framed as contingent/curable)
- Relationality: Mixed but mismatch-leaning (failure framed as fit, not essence)

**Two-layer model validated:** Noir is atmosphere; mismatch is mechanism.

---

### Task 1.2: Sharp Memory — VERIFIED WITH QUALIFICATIONS (15 entries)

**Core claims validated:**
- Memory is procedurally precise: STRONG (E01-E05, E10-E12, E15)
- Prose texture tightens for Matrix passages: VERIFIED
- Phantom-limb structure: DEFENSIBLE ("trying to reach the console that wasn't there")
- Loss framed as severance, not decay: SUPPORTED (E14)

**Second-pass additions (Ch.2, 4, 8):**
- E09: Pre-restoration anticipation ("Seven days... he'd see the matrix")
- E10: Technical simstim/matrix comparison
- E11-E12: Procedural system knowledge (Mole series, icebreakers)
- E13-E14: Access urgency and severance framing
- E15: Cyberspace relationship to physical deck (Zion)

**Critical refinement — domain-specific precision:**
Counter-evidence: "I don't have this good a memory" — Case can't recall the lines on his palms. Memory precision is **domain-specific** (matrix/interface), not globally sharp.

**Qualifications:**
- Affective tone is mixed, not purely cold
- Occasional elegiac phrasing ("bodiless exultation," "the Fall") must be acknowledged
- Distinguish cognitive precision from emotional coldness

**Second-pass finding:** Pattern deepened, not shifted. Memory is precise in operational domains but not globally sharp — supports domain-specific claim rather than universal one.

**Precision discriminant:** Strong mismatch signal — procedural specificity exceeds noir mood alone.

---

## Phase 2 Findings (Complete)

### Task 2.1: Time Phenomenology — VERIFIED WITH QUALIFICATIONS (28 entries)

**Core pattern validated:**
- Deprivation time: Accumulating and erosive (E01-E03, E05)
- Active/Matrix time: Compressing, absorbed, task-structured (E08-E14, E18-E22, E27-E28)
- Memory/anticipation: Future-pull present, countdown structure (E06)
- Transition (TRN): Fragmented, discontinuous (E16-E17, E25) — **gap filled**
- Outside post-restoration (OUT): Externally structured, access-flattened (E23-E24, E26)

**Second-pass additions (Ch.4, 5, 8, 12, 13, 14):**
- E16-E17: Simstim switch discontinuity ("two-second warning," "few frightened seconds")
- E18-E22: Dense Sense/Net operation timestamps and phased minutes
- E23-E24: Zion scheduling + "I jack in and I'm not here" (time flattening)
- E25-E26: Wintermute subjective time split, compressed schedule
- E27-E28: Anticipated absorption length, matrix dilation reinforced

**Qualifications:**
- Deprivation also includes acceleration imagery ("fast-forward button") — not pure stretching
- Future orientation persists pre-restoration ("Seven days and he'd jack in")
- Post-restoration time is measured with precision, not just collapsed

**ADHD resonance assessment:**
- Time blindness: SUPPORTED ("lost track of days," five-hour collapse)
- Hyperfocus collapse: SUPPORTED (five hours, nine hours, lost days)
- External structure dependence: SUPPORTED (Molly's deadlines, operational timestamps)
- Future as unreal: MIXED (fading hope, but countdown shows future-pull returns)
- Transition discontinuity: SUPPORTED (simstim switches) — **new**

**Second-pass finding:** Patterns deepened, not shifted. TRN gap filled, ACT/OUT coverage expanded. Time distortion is state-dependent with operational clock-time coexistence.

**Pacing analysis confirmed:** Narrative form encodes temporal phenomenology — long attritional paragraphs in Chiba, compressed summaries during runs, timestamp precision during operations.

---

### Task 2.2: Addiction Framing — SUPPORTED WITH QUALIFICATIONS (20 entries)

**Core thesis tested:** "Addiction operates as institutional misdescription — a label that explains Case to systems that cannot represent functional mismatch."

**Speaker attribution findings (expanded):**
- Narrator uses "addiction" for Linda and Zone — not directly applied to Case
- Institutional voices (Deane: "clean"; Armitage: "dangerous dependency") use it instrumentally
- Case self-labels: "I'm a drug addict, Cath... stimulants" (must acknowledge)
- Third parties: Riviera characterized as "speedball artist," 3Jane dismisses drug use as "boring"

**Second-pass additions (20 total entries):**
- E10-E14: Ambient jokes, third-party dependence (Riviera), elite dismissal (3Jane)
- E15: Molly notes Case "incapable of getting off on amphetamine or cocaine" (blocked effects)
- E16-E17: Riviera's cocaine/meperidine use, "speedball artist"
- E18: Case's explicit stimulant preference ("No coke, no amphetamines, but up")
- E19-E20: **Betaphenethylamine rush + hangover** — actual intoxication/comedown cycle documented

**Experience vs. label:**
- Matrix longing: persistent, functional, phantom-limb structure (deprivation pattern)
- Stimulant use: cyclical, hedonic, with documented comedown (E20) — **addiction pattern confirmed**
- **The text distinguishes these two dependencies**

**Restoration scene:**
- Euphoria present: "flowed, flowered... tears of release"
- Homecoming present: "distanceless home, his country"
- Function present: operational coherence, time collapse
- **Verdict: Mixed** — not purely intoxication, not purely technical return

**Second-pass finding:** Patterns deepened, not shifted. Explicit substance language (cocaine, amphetamine, betaphenethylamine) strengthens evidence that Case has *real drug addiction* alongside *distinct functional matrix-access need*. The institutional misdescription thesis holds for matrix access specifically.

---

### Task 2.3: Environmental Markers — VALIDATED WITH OSCILLATION (18 entries + 14 environments)

**Core thesis tested:** "The novel oscillates between medical and interactional framings—but its functional logic resolves in favour of access, not cure."

**Attribution inventory (18 entries):**
- Internal framing present: "damaged his nervous system," "prison of his own flesh," "still meat" (E12), nervous system fragility (E13)
- External framing: "make sure he never worked again" (E10), mycotoxin caused by others (E11), "locked in a library vault" (E14)
- Interactional framing dominant: "no console man," "I jack in and I'm not here" (E15), cyberspace decoupled from location (E16), "Straylight was all wrong" (E17)

**Second-pass additions (Ch.1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 17):**
- E10-E11: External punitive denial and cause
- E12-E13: Internal limits (arena fear, post-repair fragility)
- E14: External access barrier (Sense/Net vault)
- E15-E16: Interactional fit and decoupling (Zion)
- E17: Spatial mismatch (Straylight)
- E18: Medical framing layered on control (toxin sacs)

**Affordance map expanded (4 → 14 environments):**
- Meatspace: Chiba City, Night City, Chatsubo, Coffin hotel, Freeside, Straylight Villa, BAMA/Sprawl
- Matrix: Memory, Sense/Net, Straylight, Restored access
- Other: Simstim (Molly's body), Finn's construct, Neuromancer's beach

**Model assessment:**
- Medical model: Has support (real damage acknowledged)
- Social model: Partial (punishment is punitive denial)
- Interactional model: **Functional logic resolves here** — problem is fit/access, restoration is reconnection

**Second-pass finding:** Patterns deepened, not shifted. Added external-punitive and interactional entries plus internal-limit reminders. Affordance map now covers all major named environments.

**Counter-reading absorbed:** Internal-deficit reading has merit (damage is real), but fails because text defines loss as *specific interface*, not *global function*, and restoration reads as return-to-self.

---

## Methodological Posture

This analysis does not claim perceptual neutrality. It begins from recognition: the experience of reading *Neuromancer* and finding something that resonates with contemporary accounts of cognitive-environment mismatch. This recognition names a point of entry, not a governing explanation.

The lens is not "ADHD as diagnostic category" but "mismatch as experiential structure": a pattern that must be rendered in the text itself to hold. The structure is testable. If the deprivation state shows engagement rather than flatness, if memory degrades rather than sharpens, if restoration reads as intoxication rather than homecoming, the reading fails.

The discipline lies in testing, not in pretending to see from nowhere.

## The Noir Problem (Critical Context)

A competent SF/noir critic will object: "This is just genre-conventional alienation. You're redescribing what cyberpunk does."

This objection is serious. The research must not only verify phenomenological claims but also **test whether they exceed generic noir/cyberpunk alienation**.

**Two-layer model:**
- **Noir** names the atmosphere (political economy, genre affect, existential mood)
- **Mismatch** names the mechanism of subjectivity within that atmosphere

These can coexist. The claim is not "Neuromancer depicts alienation." The claim is: it depicts a *reversible, interface-dependent reconfiguration of cognition* with features that exceed generic genre mood.

**Three discriminants distinguish mismatch from noir:**

| Discriminant | Noir Pattern | Mismatch Pattern | Phase 1 Result |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Reversibility** | Competence spikes are aesthetic flashes inside persistent futility | Interface-state produces qualitatively different cognition | ✓ Mismatch |
| **Precision** | Longing is nostalgic, mythic, symbolic | Relation to access is procedurally exact (phantom-limb structure) | ✓ Mismatch |
| **Relationality** | Alienation is existential, persists across contexts | Mismatch is relational: appears when environment denies conditions for competence | ✓ Mixed/Mismatch |

## Evidence Logging System

**Use consistently across all tasks:**

### Evidence IDs
Format: `[Task]-E[Number]` (e.g., `1.1-E01`, `1.2-E03`, `2.2-E12`)
- Counterexamples use `X` instead of `E` (e.g., `1.1-X01`)
- This enables cross-task synthesis and citation

### Voice Channel
Tag every piece of evidence:
- **N** = Narrator (direct description)
- **FI** = Free indirect discourse (inhabiting Case's perspective)
- **D** = Dialogue (other characters speaking)

**Weight:** N and FI are strong evidence. D is weaker (reflects speaker's framework, not necessarily Case's experience). Patterns across multiple N/FI passages are strongest.

---

## Defensive Positions (Pre-Established)

The research framework has been stress-tested against three hostile reviewer positions:

### Reviewer #1: SF Formalist ("This is just noir")
**Established defense:** The two-layer model. Noir is atmosphere; mismatch is mechanism. Phase 1 validated this distinction.

### Reviewer #2: Disability Studies Skeptic ("You're romanticising impairment")
**Established defense:** Acknowledge oscillation. The text uses damage language *and* access language. Task 2.3 gathers evidence for both framings. The claim is that *functional logic* resolves toward access.

### Reviewer #3: Phenomenology Purist ("Your bracketing fails")
**Established defense:** Recognition initiates inquiry but doesn't adjudicate findings. The lens is "mismatch as structure," not "ADHD as diagnosis." Discipline lies in testing. All tasks include explicit falsification criteria.
