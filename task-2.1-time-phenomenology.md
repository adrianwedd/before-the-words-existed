# Research Task 2.1: Time Phenomenology

## Phase 2 | Evidence Gathering | Priority: High

---

## Objective

Map how temporal experience shifts across Case's different states in *Neuromancer*, gathering evidence for Section 2b of the essay.

The hypothesis:
- Deprivation produces distorted time: stretching, accumulation, drift, absence of future-pull
- Access/flow produces different time: compression, direction, urgency that feels earned
- This pattern parallels ADHD accounts of "time blindness" and hyperfocus-induced time collapse

**This task gathers evidence to test whether the text actually renders temporal phenomenology, and if so, how.**

---

## Scope

**Primary text:** Entire novel, with focus on:
- Chiba City opening (deprivation)
- Pre-restoration anticipation scenes
- First Matrix access after restoration
- Active Matrix runs
- Transitions between states

**Comparative scope:** Scenes with Molly or other characters (do they experience time differently?)

---

## Method

### Step 1: Temporal Marker Inventory

Read the novel tracking every reference to time, duration, or temporal experience:

- Explicit time references (hours, days, deadlines, waiting)
- Subjective duration markers ("it felt like," "before he knew it," "endless")
- Future orientation (planning, anticipation, dread, indifference to what comes next)
- Urgency markers (rushing, pressure, deadlines)
- Drift markers (aimlessness, purposelessness, killing time)
- Flow markers (losing track, absorption, time disappearing)

### Step 2: State Correlation

For each temporal marker, note Case's state:

| State Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| DEP | Deprivation (pre-restoration, no Matrix access) |
| MEM | Remembering/anticipating Matrix |
| RES | Just restored (first access) |
| ACT | Active Matrix operation |
| OUT | Outside Matrix but post-restoration |
| TRN | Transition moment |

### Step 3: Pattern Analysis

Look for correlations:
- Does DEP consistently produce time-stretching, drift, future-absence?
- Does ACT consistently produce time-compression, absorption, urgency?
- Are there exceptions? What explains them?

### Step 4: Evidence Tables

Populate the tables below.

## Evidence Logging System

**Evidence IDs:** Use format `2.1-E01`, `2.1-E02`, etc.

**Voice Channel:** Tag each entry:
- **N** = Narrator | **FI** = Free indirect discourse | **D** = Dialogue

---

## Evidence Table: Temporal Markers

| ID | Location | State | Temporal Marker Type | Quote/Paraphrase | Voice (N/FI/D) | Time Quality | Notes |
|----|----------|-------|---------------------|------------------|----------------|--------------|-------|
| 2.1-E01 | | | | | | | |
| 2.1-E02 | | | | | | | |
| [Add rows as needed] | | | | | | | |

**Time Quality options:**
- Stretching (feels longer than it is)
- Compressing (feels shorter than it is)
- Accumulating (piling up without direction)
- Flowing (moving toward something)
- Absent (no temporal sense at all)
- Fragmented (discontinuous, gappy)

---

## Evidence Table: State-Time Correlation

| State | Expected Time Quality | Actual Time Quality (from evidence) | Confirmed/Complicated/Contradicted |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Deprivation (DEP) | Stretching, accumulating, future-absent | | |
| Memory (MEM) | Possibly sharper, more structured? | | |
| Restoration (RES) | Transition—what happens? | | |
| Active (ACT) | Compressing, flowing, absorbed | | |
| Outside post-restoration (OUT) | Unknown—test this | | |

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **Does the text explicitly render time distortion, or must it be inferred?**
   - Look for: direct statements about how time feels
   - Look for: indirect markers (pacing, scene duration, verb tense shifts)
   - Note: inference is acceptable if grounded; flag the difference

2. **Is there a consistent pattern: deprivation = stretching, access = compression?**
   - Look for: correlation across multiple scenes
   - Watch for: exceptions that break the pattern
   - Note: pattern need not be absolute to be significant

3. **How does Case relate to the future in different states?**
   - Deprivation hypothesis: future is unreal, exerts no pull
   - Access hypothesis: future becomes present, structured, motivating
   - Test with: planning language, anticipation, deadline response

4. **Does the novel's pacing mirror the phenomenology?**
   - Look for: longer scenes during deprivation, compressed scenes during action
   - Look for: prose rhythm changes (sentence length, paragraph structure)
   - This is meta-evidence: the form encoding the content

5. **Do other characters experience time differently?**
   - Compare: Molly's temporal markers, if any
   - Compare: Armitage/Wintermute's temporal framing
   - This tests whether the temporal phenomenology is Case-specific

## ADHD Comparison Points (Handle with Care)

The essay will draw parallels to ADHD time phenomenology. Gather evidence that speaks to these specific features, but **do not force equivalence**:

| ADHD Time Feature | What to Look For in Text |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Time blindness (inability to feel time passing) | Surprise at duration, misjudging how long things take |
| Future as unreal | Failure to plan, indifference to consequences, deadline-blindness |
| Hyperfocus time collapse | Losing hours in Matrix, absorption without duration-sense |
| "Now or not now" binary | Only immediate things feel real; future doesn't motivate |
| External structure dependence | Needs deadlines, others' schedules, imposed urgency |

**Note:** The goal is resonance, not diagnosis. Find what the text offers; don't import what it doesn't.

---

## Counter-Evidence to Seek

Actively look for passages where:
- Deprivation produces urgency rather than drift
- Matrix access doesn't alter time perception
- Case plans effectively, relates to future normally
- Time distortion is universal (not Case-specific)

These complicate or qualify the reading.

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Temporal Marker Inventory
All time-related passages catalogued with state coding.

### 2. State-Time Correlation Analysis
Pattern summary for each state.

### 3. Pacing Analysis (300-400 words)
Does the novel's form encode temporal phenomenology? Specific evidence.

### 4. ADHD Resonance Points
Which features of ADHD time phenomenology have textual support? Which don't? Be precise.

### 5. Counter-Evidence Section
Passages that complicate the time-distortion reading.

### 6. Implications for Section 2b Draft
- What can be claimed confidently
- What requires qualification
- What the modeled framing missed
- Specific textual moments to reference

---

## Quality Standards

- **Track all temporal markers**, not just those supporting the hypothesis
- **Distinguish** explicit from inferred evidence
- **Note state context** for every marker
- **Test the pattern** by seeking exceptions
- **Compare to other characters** where possible
- **Don't force ADHD parallels**—note resonance and divergence equally

---

## Completion Criteria

This task is complete when:
- [ ] Temporal marker inventory has at least 15 entries across different states
- [ ] State-time correlation table is filled with evidence-based assessments
- [ ] Pacing analysis is written with specific examples
- [ ] ADHD resonance points are assessed (supported/unsupported/ambiguous)
- [ ] Counter-evidence is explicitly documented
- [ ] Implications for Section 2b are specific and actionable

---

## Dependencies

**This task should follow:** Tasks 1.1 and 1.2 (you'll have deprivation and memory passages already identified)

**This task must be completed before:** Drafting Section 2b

**This task can run in parallel with:** Tasks 2.2 and 2.3
