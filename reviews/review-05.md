Hostile Peer Review: "Before the Words Existed"

Reviewer A: The Phenomenology Purist
Perspective: Continental Philosophy / Phenomenology.
Attitude: You are using "phenomenology" as a synonym for "subjective experience" rather than a rigorous method.

1. The Strongest Objection:
Your distinction between "drug addiction" (cyclical, hedonic) and "matrix-dependency" (procedural, competent) is phenomenologically incoherent. If the lived experience of
matrix-deprivation manifests as craving, anxiety, and physical withdrawal (which the text suggests it does), then phenomenologically, it is addiction. You are imposing a
functionalist distinction (one makes him "work," one makes him "high") onto a phenomenological field that likely experiences them as identical structures of lack. You cannot
claim to be doing phenomenology while importing an external utilitarian metric ("competence") to bifurcate the experience.

2. Supporting Pressure Points:
 * The "Two-Dependency" Trap (Section 7): You claim the text distinguishes these dependencies. However, Case's "bodiless exultation" (Ch. 1) and the "tears of release" (Ch.
   3) are classic markers of the sublime and the narcotic. To say one is "homecoming" and the other is "intoxication" is an interpretive imposition, not a phenomenological
   description. The phenomenon is relief from the burden of the meat. Both provide it.
 * "Procedural Longing" vs. "Mythic Longing" (Section 4): You argue Case's longing is "procedural" because he remembers how the system works. This is weak. A heroin addict
   remembers the ritual of the spoon and the needle with "procedural precision" too. Does that make heroin addiction a "competence mismatch"?
 * The Body as "Prison" (Section 5): You treat the "body-as-prison" as a "state effect" of mismatch. A rigorous phenomenologist would ask: isn't the body always the horizon
   of experience? Case's desire to delete the body is not a "mismatch" with a specific environment; it is a fundamental negation of Dasein (being-there). You are sanitizing a
   death drive into a "fit problem."

3. The Steelman Version:
The author would argue that the text explicitly separates the outcomes: drugs lead to "the fall," while the matrix leads to "the run" (agency). The structure of time differs:
drug time loops (addiction), matrix time flows and compresses (flow state). Therefore, the phenomenological structure (temporality and agency) is distinct, even if the affect
(craving) is similar.

4. Verdict:
Wounds the argument. The essay successfully distinguishes the temporal structures, but fails to convince that the affective experience of deprivation is distinct from
withdrawal. The "Two-Dependency" model looks like special pleading to save Case from being a "junkie."

Reviewer B: The Disability Studies / Historicist (The Missing Persona)
Perspective: Disability History & Critical Theory.
Attitude: You are retrofitting a 2024 neurodiversity paradigm onto 1984, erasing the specific material history of the 80s.

1. The Strongest Objection:
The "Institutional Misdescription" thesis (Section 7) renders your argument unfalsifiable and dangerously close to conspiracy theory. By claiming that every time the
text/institutions call Case an "addict," they are "misdescribing" a cognitive style they can't understand, you create a hermeneutic seal. Any evidence that Case is just a
junkie is dismissed as "institutional bias." This erases the reality that high-functioning addicts exist and often frame their addiction as "performance enhancement" or
"necessary for work." You are taking the addict's rationalization and elevating it to a "cognitive ontology."

2. Supporting Pressure Points:
 * Flattening of "Technostress" (Section 2): You dismiss Technostress (Brod, 1984) as "externalizing" the problem. But Brod was describing exactly what you are: the friction
   between human nervous systems and digital speeds. You are not discovering a "gap"; you are renaming a filled niche. The era did have words for this; you just don't like
   them because they aren't "neurodivergent."
 * Teleological Fallacy: You imply the text is "waiting" for the Social Model of Disability (1983/1993). This treats the novel as a "pre-clinical" patient. Perhaps Gibson
   wasn't "sensing a future diagnosis" but accurately describing the capitalist production of post-human labor, where the worker is only "healthy" when plugged into the
   machine.
 * Case vs. Actual ADHD: By anchoring "mismatch" entirely to the interface (he is fine in the matrix, broken in meat), you flatten actual ADHD phenomenology, which is often
   pervasive across domains. You risk creating a "superpower" trope (the "Rain Man" error) where the disability vanishes entirely in the "right context."

3. The Steelman Version:
The author argues that "misdescription" is not a conspiracy, but a linguistic limit of the era. If the only available language for "obsessive pursuit of a machine state" was
"addiction," that's what characters would use. The essay's job is to look past the labels characters use and look at the behavior the text renders.

4. Verdict:
Kill shot on "Misdescription." The essay needs to walk this back. You cannot dismiss all counter-evidence as "misdescription." You must accept that Case might be both a
mismatched cognitive phenotype and a drug addict, and that the two feed each other.

Reviewer C: The SF Formalist
Perspective: Genre Theory / Cyberpunk Scholarship.
Attitude: You are ignoring the genre's history to claim originality.

1. The Strongest Objection:
The "Molly as Foil" argument (Section 6) collapses when you realize Molly is a genre trope, not a cognitive case study. She is the "Razor Girl" / "Hardened Pro." Her "wiring"
explanations ("it's just the way I'm wired") are standard noir/hardboiled dialogue, not neuro-phenomenological confessions. You are over-reading genre conventions (the stoic
warrior, the clumsy hacker) as deep cognitive architectures. Sometimes a cool cyborg is just a cool cyborg.

2. Supporting Pressure Points:
 * The "Naming Gap" Fabrication (Section 9): You claim Hayles, Bukatman, and Jameson "couldn't name" this state. This is arrogant. Jameson's "Schizophrenia" was the name for
   the breakdown of the signifying chain and the intense present. He didn't miss the phenomenology; he grounded it in history rather than biology. You aren't adding a "finer
   instrument"; you're replacing a sociopolitical lens with a biological/functional one.
 * Noir vs. Mechanism (Section 3): You claim "Noir explains atmosphere; mismatch explains mechanism." In Cyberpunk, atmosphere is mechanism. The rain, the decay, the
   alienation—these are the interface. You cannot separate Case's "mood" from his "function." The "glitch" is the aesthetic point.
 * The Simstim Argument: You rely heavily on Simstim (Ch 4) to prove the "relational" thesis. But Simstim is explicitly described as "passive." Of course Case feels
   trapped—he's a passenger! That doesn't prove his cognition is "interface-dependent" for agency; it just proves that being paralyzed feels bad.

3. The Steelman Version:
The author would argue that the Simstim scene is specific: it's not just passivity, it's the alien nature of Molly's sensorium (threat-scanning, proprioceptive awareness)
that Case finds jarring. It highlights that he doesn't just lack control; he lacks the perceptual filter to inhabit her world comfortably.

4. Verdict:
Wounds the argument. The essay needs to prove that Molly's "wiring" is treated by the text as a constraint (like Case's), not just a cool feature. The "Naming Gap" section
needs to be less dismissive of Jameson/Bukatman—frame it as a "shift in scale" (macro-cultural vs. micro-cognitive) rather than a "failure to name."

Additional Attacks

5. Methodological Critique (The Evidence Log):
The "Task IDs" (e.g., 1.1-E01) are theater. They simulate empiricism, but the decision to tag a sentence as "Deprivation" vs. "Noir Mood" is entirely subjective. This
pseudo-scientific apparatus distracts from the fact that you are doing close reading, just like everyone else. Recommendation: Keep the close reading, cut the pretense of a
"data set."

6. Historical Critique:
The "residual type" (ADD) framing is accurate for 1980, but you ignore the gendered aspect of this history. 1984 computer culture was heavily male-coded. Is "Cognitive
Mismatch" just a way of pathologizing/medicalizing toxic masculinity and social isolation?

7. Rhetorical Critique:
The "lab coat" tone (e.g., "The proof is not in a single scene but in reversibility") is grating. It implies previous critics were "guessing" while you are "measuring." It
sets a bar for evidence you don't actually clear.

8. The Missing Counter-Reading (The Marxist/Labor Reading):
The strongest alternative you ignore is the Labor Alienation reading. Case is not "mismatched" with the world; he is alienated from his labor. The matrix is the only place
where his labor power has value. When he is locked out, he is not "cognitively deprived"; he is unemployed in a hyper-capitalist dystopia. His "symptoms" are the symptoms of
the reserve army of labor. The essay ignores the economic engine of Neuromancer to focus on a "brain" engine.

Final Verdict

Survivability Rating: 60%
The core observation—that Case's competence is interface-dependent and procedural—is strong and textually supported. However, the attempt to completely separate this from
addiction ("Two-Dependency") and the dismissal of previous criticism ("Naming Gap") are weak points that will crumble under scrutiny.

The Fatal Flaw:
The "Institutional Misdescription" thesis. It is a defensive wall that makes the argument unfalsifiable. By claiming the text "lies" about addiction whenever it contradicts
your thesis, you lose your claim to be "following the evidence."

Recommended Revision Priority:
 1. Drop the "Misdescription" claim. Acknowledge that Case is both an addict and a specific cognitive phenotype, and that the text conflates them because Case conflates them.
 2. Engage the Labor/Marxist reading. Acknowledge that "mismatch" might be the biological substrate of "alienated labor."
 3. Soften the critique of Jameson/Bukatman. Frame your contribution as "micro-phenomenological" complement, not a correction of their "failure."
 4. De-emphasize the "Data/Lab Coat" rhetoric. It promises a scientific objectivity that literary criticism cannot deliver.
