### **Reviewer A: The Phenomenology Purist**

**1. Strongest Objection**  
Your “phenomenological reading” is a smuggled hybrid of narratology and disability studies, not rigorous phenomenology. You never establish a first-person experiential framework; instead, you treat textual representations as direct reports of consciousness, committing a category error between how a narrative *depicts* experience and how experience is *lived*.

**2. Supporting Pressure Points**  
- You claim to “bracket” diagnosis but constantly import clinical and neurodiversity terminology (“time blindness,” “hyperfocus,” “phantom-limb structure”) as explanatory tools, undermining your phenomenological purity.  
- The “pre-clinical sensing” hypothesis is circular: you argue Gibson preserves an experience before it was named, but you use later frameworks to identify that experience, creating a hermeneutic loop that cannot be falsified.  
- Your discriminants (reversibility, precision, relationality) are analytic constructs, not phenomenological invariants derived from the text’s own intentional structures. You impose a model rather than disclose one.  
- You collapse the distinction between Case’s *depicted* consciousness and Gibson’s *prose style*, treating shifts in narrative pacing as direct evidence of phenomenological states without justifying that equivalence.

**3. The Steelman Version**  
A defender would argue that literary phenomenology necessarily operates at the level of textual consciousness, not lived introspection, and that the method is transparent about its hybridity. The “pre-clinical” claim is not circular but historical: later vocabularies help us see what was *already* encoded, not retroactively imposed.

**4. Verdict**  
**Wounds the argument.** The methodological fuzziness between phenomenology, narratology, and diagnostic inference is a significant vulnerability, though not fatal if reframed as a consciously interdisciplinary close reading.

### **Reviewer B: The Disability Studies Skeptic**

**1. Strongest Objection**  
Your essay risks romanticizing cognitive difference by framing Case’ matrix access as a “return to competence” rather than a technologically mediated dependency, implicitly validating a “right interface” solutionism that ignores the political economy of access and the reality of embodied suffering.

**2. Supporting Pressure Points**  
- The two-dependency model is suspiciously convenient: by separating drug addiction (“real”) from matrix longing (“functional”), you insulate Case’s core identity from pathology, a move that feels like special pleading.  
- The “institutional misdescription” thesis is unfalsifiable—any time the text or a character uses addiction language, you can dismiss it as a misunderstanding of “true” access-dependency.  
- You appropriate ADHD-adjacent phenomenology (“time blindness,” “hyperfocus”) without engaging with disability scholarship that critiques such analogies as reductive or appropriative.  
- The essay flattens the embodied reality of actual cognitive disability by treating Case’s restoration as a clean, reversible switch, ignoring how real mismatch is often chronic and socially embedded.

**3. The Steelman Version**  
A defender would argue that the essay explicitly avoids claiming Case “has” ADHD and instead uses mismatch as a structural metaphor. The two-dependency model is textually grounded in the different narrative treatments of drug scenes versus matrix scenes, not a protective maneuver.

**4. Verdict**  
**Wounds the argument.** The political and ethical risks of romanticization and appropriation are serious, but the essay’s explicit disclaimers about diagnosis provide some defense. The unfalsifiability of “misdescription” is a heavier blow.

### **Reviewer C: The SF Formalist / Genre Specialist**

**1. Strongest Objection**  
You construct a “naming gap” strawman: Bukatman, Hayles, and Jameson were not “missing” the phenomenology you describe; they were theorizing it at a cultural and historical level, not at the granular cognitive level you prefer. Your claim to novelty is largely a shift in scale, not insight.

**2. Supporting Pressure Points**  
- You dismiss noir as “mood” but ignore that noir *is* a structural logic of alienation, not just atmosphere. Your discriminants are rigged to favor a cognitive reading by defining noir reductively.  
- The Molly contrast is genre convention: the hyper-competent street samurai is a cyberpunk trope. To treat her as a “different interface” is to over-read what is essentially a plot device for sensory exposition.  
- Your “parallel case” of Dick is weakly analogous: Dick’s concerns are ontological and epistemological, not interface-cognitive in Gibson’s techno-materialist sense. The comparison is suggestive but not methodologically probative.  
- You selectively cite early criticism (e.g., Spinrad, Maddox) that supports your “gap” thesis while ignoring contemporary reviews that did note Case’s psychological specificity.

**3. The Steelman Version**  
A defender would argue that the shift in scale *is* the insight: earlier critics lacked the vocabulary to describe the *mechanism* of interface-dependence, even if they sensed its effects. The Molly contrast is textually substantiated via simstim, not just trope.

**4. Verdict**  
**Wounds the argument.** The strawman charge is damaging, as is the over-reading of Molly. The essay’s claim to novelty is overstated, but its close-reading of interface shifts remains valuable even if not entirely original.

### **Additional Attacks**

**5. Methodological Critique**  
Your evidence-logging system (Task IDs, voice channels) creates a veneer of empiricism but masks interpretive leaps. Tagging a passage as “Free Indirect” or “Narrator” does not objectively ground your phenomenological claims; it simply labels the narrative layer from which you’ve chosen to infer consciousness. This is close reading with a spreadsheet, not scientific rigor.

**6. Historical Critique**  
Your 1984 framing is tendentious. DSM-III’s “ADD, Residual Type” (314.80) did exist, and adult ADHD was emerging in research circles; to claim there was “no stable public language” overlooks subcultural and clinical discourses already in circulation. You also compress the neurodiversity timeline—Sinclair’s 1993 essay was seminal but not the absolute start of advocacy. These elisions exaggerate the “gap” you need for your thesis.

**7. Rhetorical Critique**  
The “lab coat with collar up” tone is a defensive posture: it signals rigor while allowing you to hedge (“This is not a diagnostic claim…”) when convenient. You make strong interpretive assertions but retreat to “descriptive, not diagnostic” when challenged, creating an argument that is both bold and slippery.

**8. The Missing Counter-Reading**  
The strongest unengaged reading is a **Marxist/technocapitalist critique**: Case’s “mismatch” is not a cognitive style but the alienated condition of labor under cybernetic capital. His longing for the matrix is the worker’s longing for the means of production from which he has been severed. This reading accounts for reversibility, precision, and environmental affordance without resorting to cognitive models, and it aligns more deeply with cyberpunk’s materialist critique.

### **Final Verdict**

- **Survivability Rating**: 60%. The core close-reading of interface-dependent cognition is compelling, but the supporting frameworks (phenomenological method, historical gap, critical novelty) are significantly wounded.

- **Fatal Flaw (if any)**: The **unfalsifiability of the “misdescription” thesis** is the closest to fatal. If all contradictory evidence can be dismissed as institutional or narrative misrecognition, the argument becomes circular and resistant to critique.

- **Recommended Revision Priority**:
  1. **Reframe the methodology** as interdisciplinary close reading, not pure phenomenology.
  2. **Drop or severely qualify the “naming gap” claim**; acknowledge that earlier critics framed the phenomenon differently.
  3. **Engage the Marxist counter-reading** to strengthen the relational model.
  4. **Clarify the two-dependency model** with more textual evidence that distinguishes drug scenes from matrix scenes at the level of prose, not just plot.
  5. **Tone down the “lab coat” rhetoric**; it invites skepticism you cannot fully dispel.

The essay is salvageable as a strong interdisciplinary reading, but it must shed its pretensions to methodological purity and historical singularity.
