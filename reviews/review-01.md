### Five plausible failure modes (and how likely each is to sink you)

1. **Category error (phenomenology cosplay):** you call it “phenomenology” but operate like an affordance/functionalism model. **P≈0.28**
2. **Circular mechanism:** “mismatch” is defined as interface-dependent reversibility, then “proved” by interface-dependent reversibility. **P≈0.24**
3. **Ethical/disciplinary overreach:** disability/neurodiversity vocabulary is used as an epistemic crowbar while disavowing diagnosis. **P≈0.18**
4. **Historical slippage:** key timeline claims (esp. Utah criteria) are off, weakening the “before the words existed” spine. **P≈0.18**
5. **Genealogy strawman:** you under-credit cyberpunk criticism’s existing tools to manufacture a “naming gap.” **P≈0.12**

Now, the knives.

## Reviewer A — The Phenomenology Purist

### 1) The Strongest Objection (2–3 sentences)

You keep saying “phenomenology,” but what you actually do is **interface-functionalism dressed in continental tailoring**: cognition “coheres” when a tool is present and “collapses” when it’s absent. That’s not a phenomenological category—it's a mechanistic dependency claim. Your “falsifiability” rhetoric reads like scientistic theatre stapled onto close reading.

### 2) Supporting Pressure Points (3–5)

* **No epoché, no reduction.** You announce “phenomenological reading,” then immediately anchor it in *correlation with interface access* (a causal/operational register) rather than intentional structure.
* **“Mismatch” is imported, not derived.** The essay defines mismatch as “reversible, interface-dependent” cognition —a framework imported from contemporary disability/affordance talk, then retrofitted as if it were discovered in the text.
* **You conflate phenomenology with narratology/stylistics.** “When the interface returns, the mood lifts, and the prose tightens…” treats prose modulation as direct access to lived structure, without arguing why narratorial technique equals phenomenological description.
* **“Pre-clinical sensing” is romanticized hermeneutics.** You claim SF “preserves phenomenology before vocabulary stabilizes”, but you never specify what would count as *not* preservation vs. merely the critic’s reconstruction.
* **Bracketing is asserted, not performed.** “Not diagnostic” is repeated like a warding charm, while the historical section smuggles clinical objects (DSM, Utah criteria) to stabilize an experiential type.

### 3) The Steelman Version (and is it adequate?)

**Defense:** “I’m doing a *literary phenomenology*—describing experiential structures as rendered in prose, not Husserlian reduction. ‘Mismatch’ is a heuristic name for a recurring intentional pattern; falsifiability is a discipline against wishful readings.”
**Adequacy:** Partial. You still owe a rigorous bridge from (a) textual form to (b) lived structure. Right now you oscillate between *description* and *explanation* without marking the seam. As a phenomenology paper, this attack **wounds the core method claim**.

### 4) Verdict

**Kills it as phenomenology**, but only **wounds it as literary affordance analysis**. You can survive—if you stop pretending Merleau-Ponty signed off.

## Reviewer B — The Disability Studies Skeptic

### 1) The Strongest Objection (2–3 sentences)

You want the authority of disability/neurodiversity frameworks without paying their methodological and political costs. By splitting “drug addiction” from “matrix-access dependency”, you get to acknowledge pathology and then launder the more central craving into a morally cleaner “fit problem.” That’s exactly how appropriation works: clinical and activist vocabularies become interpretive resources while lived-experience scholarship is absent.

### 2) Supporting Pressure Points (3–5)

* **The two-dependency model is convenient to the point of suspicion.** “Addiction… separate cycle from access-dependency” reads like a carve-out designed to protect the thesis from the obvious objection (“he’s just an addict”).
* **“Institutional misdescription” is unfalsifiable by design.** You explicitly frame institutions as systematically misreading mismatch as deviance —which lets any counterevidence be dismissed as… misdescription.
* **Neurodiversity timeline is used as rhetorical ballast, not engaged as scholarship.** You invoke “neurotypical/neurodiversity/neurodivergent” as if naming resolves power, but you do not grapple with disability studies debates about medicalization, productivity narratives, or “fit” as neoliberal assimilation.
* **Romanticization denial is performative.** You say there’s a “risk of romanticizing… superpower” and deny it, but your structure repeatedly implies competence “reactivates” when the correct interface appears—functionally, a techno-accommodation salvation plot.
* **Phenomenology-by-proxy flattens ADHD/autistic lived experience.** You treat Case as a legible node in “adult cognitive mismatch” discourse without citing lived-experience accounts or disability scholarship that would make such mapping ethically defensible.

### 3) The Steelman Version (and is it adequate?)

**Defense:** “I explicitly say ‘not diagnostic’ and warn against superpower readings. I’m making a relational, non-moralizing claim: competence is contingent on affordances, not character.”
**Adequacy:** Not enough. Disavowing diagnosis is not the same as avoiding appropriation. The essay leans on disability-adjacent legitimacy while staying safely in literary territory—*the classic one-way simstim of theory*: you take the sensation stream, but you don’t give anything back.

### 4) Verdict

**Wounds the ethical framing and destabilizes the “recognition” payoff.** It doesn’t kill the reading outright, but it makes the essay vulnerable to a very easy charge: *you’re using disability discourse as narrative leverage.*

---

## Reviewer C — The SF Formalist / Genre Specialist

### 1) The Strongest Objection (2–3 sentences)

Your “naming gap” is largely manufactured by selective framing. Cyberpunk criticism did not “miss” interface-mediated subjectivity; it theorized it differently—and often at the correct scale (capital, postmodern time, embodiment politics). You rebrand existing insights as if they lacked “tools”, then declare victory because your tool measures what it was built to measure.

### 2) Supporting Pressure Points (3–5)

* **Strawman by calibration.** You claim earlier frameworks “circle the same absence” and “none can name” interface-dependent coherence —but “naming” isn’t the point of Jameson/Hayles/Bukatman. They’re not doing your project, so “they didn’t do it” is not a critique, it’s a category mismatch.
* **Discriminants are rigged.** Reversibility/precision/relationality already presuppose your model: you define mismatch as reversible + interface-linked, then treat reversible + interface-linked as confirming evidence.
* **Noir dismissal is glib.** “Noir is a mood; it is not a mechanism” is the kind of sentence people write when they haven’t earned the dismissal. Noir mechanisms include compulsion, fatalism, labor alienation, and self-destruction—precisely what you’re recoding as “mismatch.”
* **Molly as “controlled experiment” is overclaim.** You call simstim “rare controlled experiment”, but the scene is doing genre work (cool competence, gendered spectacle, action telemetry). Your “embodied cognition” reading risks being just “she’s the razor-girl archetype.”
* **Your scale keeps shrinking to protect the thesis.** When broader readings threaten (capitalist subjectivity, ideology, embodiment politics), you retreat into “smaller and more mechanical”, which looks like methodological opportunism.

### 3) The Steelman Version (and is it adequate?)

**Defense:** “I’m not displacing Jameson/Hayles/Bukatman; I’m adding a finer instrument for cognitive texture under interface change.”
**Adequacy:** Only if you stop implying the field *couldn’t* do it. Right now, the genealogy reads like a legitimacy ladder you built so you can climb it. As a genre specialist, I’d say this attack **seriously wounds the novelty claim**.

### 4) Verdict

**Wounds the contribution claim; threatens publication in an SF studies venue.** The reading might survive, but not the posture that it is “what earlier critics couldn’t name.”

# Additional Attacks

## 5) Methodological Critique

The Task IDs / voice-channel tags are **a choreography of rigor**, not rigor itself. You do not show the evidence log; you *claim* it exists, then ask the reader to trust that interpretive choices were disciplined. Worse: the discriminants are not independent tests; they’re re-statements of your core predicate (“interface modulates agency”), so the method risks becoming a closed loop: define → detect → declare falsifiable.

## 6) Historical Critique

Two problems: one factual, one conceptual.

* **Factual slippage (Utah criteria):** you place “Wender’s Utah Criteria” in the 1980s, but clinical literature commonly ties the Wender-Reimherr scale and Utah criteria to Wender (1995) and characterizes the Utah criteria as proposed in the 1990s. ([PubMed][1])
* **DSM-III residual type is broadly right but your rhetoric overreaches:** DSM-III did have “ADD, Residual Type” criteria requiring earlier hyperactive ADD and noting persistence of inattention/impulsivity ([ERIC][2])—so your “hyperactivity gate” point is defensible. But your claim that DSM-III “displaced” hyperactivity is rhetorically slippery; DSM-III still structurally centers hyperactivity in how residual-type continuity is established. ([ERIC][2])
* **Neurodiversity timeline is mostly fine but simplistic:** “neurotypical” linked to 1990s online autism communities ([Wikipedia][3]); “neurodivergent” is often credited to Kassiane Asasumasu (circa 2000) ([National Autistic Society][4]). Your problem is not dates so much as the insinuation that once words exist, the phenomenon becomes legible “cleanly.” History doesn’t work like that.

## 7) Rhetorical Critique

The “lab coat / collar up” line is a confession: you’re performing controlled swagger to borrow epistemic authority. You also hedge strategically—“not diagnostic,” “modest but decisive,” “bounded,” “analogical rather than diagnostic”—which creates a one-way valve: bold interpretive claims go out; responsibility for clinical/ethical implications gets deflected. The tone manufactures inevitability while the argument quietly keeps exits open.

## 8) The Missing Counter-Reading

The strongest alternative you barely touch is **political economy / labor ontology**: Case isn’t “mismatched,” he’s **deskilled and dispossessed**—a worker whose means of production (deck access) has been revoked, leaving only withdrawal, resentment, and street-level violence. The “coherence returns” because he is reinserted into the only system that recognizes and rewards his specialization—capitalist cyberspace as labor substrate—not because his neurotype finds its habitat. This reading can absorb reversibility, procedural longing, and state-dependent time without importing clinical/neurodiversity frames, and it arguably fits Jameson’s scale better than your “smaller circuit” move.

---

# Final Verdict

### Survivability Rating

**~45% survives** adversarial review.

### Fatal Flaw (if any)

**Circularity + category inflation:** “mismatch” is defined in the very terms you use to “test” it, while “phenomenology” is invoked as prestige rather than method. If this remains, reviewers will treat the piece as rhetorically forceful but methodologically unserious.

### Recommended Revision Priority (before submission)

1. **Stop calling it phenomenology unless you earn it** (or reframe honestly as affordance-based narratology).
2. **Fix the Utah criteria timeline** (1980s claim is a liability).
3. **De-circularize the discriminants** (show how a noir/capital reading could pass them).
4. **Either engage disability studies seriously or remove the borrowed authority** (right now it’s extractive).

That’s the autopsy. If you want the essay to live, you’ll have to decide what it is: a phenomenology paper, an SF studies intervention, or a sharp affordance reading with historical texture. Right now it’s trying to be all three—and the seams show.
