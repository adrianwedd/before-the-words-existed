# Round 2: Hostile Peer Review of Revised Draft

**Source:** Gemini-cli
**Survivability Rating:** 90%

---

I have reviewed the revised draft of track-c-draft.md. The author has significantly strengthened the essay by incorporating the previous critique.

---

## Reviewer A: The Phenomenology Purist

**Status: Pacified (mostly).**

The shift from "Phenomenology" to "Experiential-Structural Reading" is a smart tactical retreat. It lowers the philosophical stakes and focuses on textual mechanics.

* **Remaining Friction:** The "Two-Dependency" section is much better. By framing it as "Conflation" rather than "Misdescription," you avoid the conspiracy theory trap. You now argue that the text shows overlap but narrates distinction via temporality. This is defensible.

* **Verdict:** Pass. The argument no longer claims to overthrow Husserl; it just claims to read Gibson closely.

## Reviewer B: The Disability Studies / Historicist

**Status: Engaged.**

* **The Gender Add:** The brief acknowledgment of the "male-coded" history (Section 2) is necessary protection. It prevents the critique that you are universalizing a specific white-male-hacker experience.

* **The Labor Integration:** The new paragraph in Counter-Readings (Section 11) regarding the "Marxist/Labor reading" is excellent. By positioning mismatch as the "micro-structure" of "labor alienation," you have co-opted your most dangerous rival rather than fighting them.

* **Verdict:** Pass. You have insulated the essay against the charge of ignoring political economy.

## Reviewer C: The SF Formalist

**Status: Respectful Nod.**

* **Scale Shift:** Renaming the "Naming Gap" to "Scale Shift" (Section 9) saves the essay from arrogance. You are no longer claiming Jameson was blind; you are claiming he was looking at the skyline while you are looking at the wiring. This allows you to coexist with the canon.

* **Verdict:** Pass. The critique of the canon is now additive, not destructive.

## Final Assessment

**Survivability Rating: 90%**

The essay is now robust. It has abandoned its most brittle claims (Misdescription, "Lab Coat" objectivity) and fortified its strongest ones (the procedural nature of Case's cognition).

### Remaining Weaknesses (Minor):

* **The "Task IDs" (Notes):** They are still a bit theatrical for a literary essay, but they are no longer claimed to be "scientific proof." They now function as a shorthand for close reading. A copyeditor might ask you to remove them, but they don't harm the logic anymore.

* **Simstim Argument:** The "Molly as Interface" section is strong, but a skeptic might still say you are downplaying her agency to make your point about Case. However, you've hedged this enough to survive.

### Recommendation:

The essay is ready for submission or final polish. The argument is tight, the concessions are strategic, and the evidence is aligned with the claims.
