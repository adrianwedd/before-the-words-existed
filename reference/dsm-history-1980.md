## The 1980 DSM-III Shift

The publication of the **DSM-III** in **1980** by the American Psychiatric Association marked a paradigm shift in the diagnosis of attentional disorders. It renamed "Hyperkinetic Reaction of Childhood" (DSM-II, 1968) to "**Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD)**" (with or without hyperactivity).

This change was monumental. It shifted the clinical focus from *hyperactivity* (a behavioral, physical excess) to *inattention* (a cognitive deficit). It acknowledged that one could be physically still but cognitively fragmented. This era marks the beginning of the "medicalization of attention," where the inability to focus on a single linear stream of information became a pathology.

*Neuromancer* (1984) arrives at the exact moment this diagnosis is permeating the cultural subconscious.

## Timeline: Evolution of Attention Diagnosis

| Year | Diagnostic Manual | Terminology | Key Phenomenological Feature |
|------|-------------------|-------------|------------------------------|
| 1968 | DSM-II | Hyperkinetic Reaction of Childhood | Focus on physical restlessness (motor) |
| **1980** | **DSM-III** | **Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD)** | **Focus on inattention / cognitive fragmentation** |
| 1987 | DSM-III-R | Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) | Re-integration of hyperactivity |
| 1994 | DSM-IV | ADHD (three subtypes) | Predominantly inattentive / hyperactive-impulsive / combined |

## Key Dates for "Before the Words Existed" Argument

- **1980:** ADD enters DSM-III — first formal recognition of attention as the core deficit
- **1984:** *Neuromancer* published — Gibson describes phenomenology without clinical vocabulary
- **1987:** ADHD terminology stabilizes in DSM-III-R

Gibson was writing in a window where:
- The *concept* of attention deficit had just been clinically named (1980)
- The *vocabulary* had not yet become culturally ubiquitous
- Adult ADHD was not yet formally recognized (DSM-IV, 1994, first acknowledged persistence into adulthood)

This supports the claim that *Neuromancer* encodes phenomenology that the diagnostic apparatus of its era could not yet name — particularly for adults.

## Usage Notes

This material supports Task 3.3's objective: document what language *didn't exist* in 1984.

Key claims this enables:
- Gibson couldn't have been "writing ADHD" because the adult form wasn't clinically recognized
- The phenomenology precedes the diagnosis
- Literature can stabilize experience before medicine flattens it

Handle with care: Don't overclaim. The parallel is suggestive, not causal.
