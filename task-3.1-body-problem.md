# Research Task 3.1: The Body Problem

## Phase 3 | Track C Preparation | Priority: Medium

---

## Objective

Determine whether Case's dismissal of the body as "meat" is ideological (a philosophical stance he holds) or phenomenological (a dissociative experience he lives).

The hypothesis:
- Case's meat-disdain may not be cyberpunk transcendence fantasy
- It may instead reflect dissociative phenomenology: failure to receive or integrate bodily signals
- This parallels ADHD accounts of interoceptive difficulty (missing hunger, ignoring fatigue, poor proprioception)

**This task is preparatory for Track C (academic paper) and optional for Track B (standalone essay).**

---

## Scope

**Primary text:** Entire novel, tracking all body-related passages

**Focus areas:**
- Explicit "meat" language and body-dismissal
- Moments of bodily awareness or failure of awareness
- Physical sensations registered or ignored
- Body as obstacle, vehicle, or prison
- Contrast with Molly's embodiment (preliminary)

## Key Distinction

| Ideology | Phenomenology |
|----------|---------------|
| Articulated belief | Lived experience |
| "The body is inferior to mind" | Failure to notice bodily signals |
| Chosen stance | Unchosen condition |
| Could be argued against | Can only be described |
| Cyberpunk trope | Potential neurodivergent marker |

**The question:** When Case says or implies the body doesn't matter, is he *asserting a position* or *reporting an experience*?

---

## Method

### Step 1: Body Passage Inventory

Locate every moment where Case:
- Explicitly references his body or "meat"
- Registers bodily signals (hunger, thirst, fatigue, pain, temperature, arousal)
- Fails to register bodily signals (shown by surprise, collapse, external correction)
- Speaks dismissively about embodiment
- Experiences the body as obstacle or burden
- Is forced into bodily awareness by circumstance

### Step 2: Categorisation

For each passage, categorise:

| Category | Description | Example Markers |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Ideological rejection | Articulated belief that flesh is inferior | Statements, arguments, assertions |
| Dissociative phenomenology | Failure to receive/integrate bodily signals | Surprise at hunger, missing fatigue, delayed pain |
| Instrumental tolerance | Body as necessary but unloved vehicle | Maintenance without investment |
| Forced awareness | External circumstances making body undeniable | Injury, illness, physical threat |

### Step 3: Pattern Analysis

Look for:
- Which category dominates?
- Is there a pattern (e.g., dissociation except when forced)?
- Does the pattern change across the novel?
- Does ideology appear *after* phenomenology (as rationalisation)?

### Step 4: ADHD Comparison

Map findings against ADHD interoceptive accounts:

| ADHD Feature | Description | Evidence in Text? |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Missing hunger cues | Not noticing hunger until crashing | |
| Ignoring fatigue | Pushing past exhaustion without registering | |
| Poor proprioception | Not knowing where body is in space, clumsiness | |
| Delayed pain registration | Not feeling pain until later or unless attention directed | |
| Difficulty "listening to body" | General interoceptive disconnect | |

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **When Case dismisses the body, is he making an argument or describing an experience?**
   - Look for: philosophical statements vs. experiential reports
   - Look for: the *context* of meat-dismissal (when does it arise?)

2. **Does Case fail to notice bodily signals before being forced to?**
   - Look for: surprise at physical state, collapse, external correction
   - If frequent: supports dissociative reading
   - If rare: supports ideological reading

3. **Is the meat-disdain consistent or context-dependent?**
   - Does it appear only in certain states (deprivation, Matrix, action)?
   - Does it intensify or diminish across the novel?

4. **Does ideology appear as rationalisation of phenomenology?**
   - Pattern to look for: first Case *fails* to register body, *then* he articulates dismissal
   - This would suggest ideology is downstream of experience

5. **How does Case's embodiment compare to Molly's?**
   - Preliminary only (full comparison in Task 3.2)
   - Does Molly represent a different relationship to body?
   - Does contrast illuminate Case's phenomenology?

## Counter-Reading to Engage

**The pure-ideology reading:** Case's meat-dismissal is standard cyberpunk transcendence fantasy. Reading it as dissociation imports an anachronistic framework (ADHD phenomenology) onto a genre trope.

To address this:
- Acknowledge: the trope exists and Gibson is working within it
- Distinguish: trope as vehicle vs. trope as explanation
- Show: where the text exceeds or complicates the trope
- Test: does the *pattern* of body-moments support ideology or phenomenology?

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Body Passage Inventory
All body-related passages located and categorised.

### 2. Bodily Signal Analysis
Table showing what signals are registered, missed, or forced.

### 3. Category Distribution
Which category dominates? Is there a pattern?

### 4. ADHD Resonance Assessment
Which interoceptive features have textual support? Which don't?

### 5. Ideology vs. Phenomenology Argument (400-500 words)
Based on evidence, what is the stronger reading? With what qualifications?

### 6. Counter-Reading Response
Where does the pure-ideology reading have merit? Where does it fail?

### 7. Implications for Track C
- How this analysis extends the core argument
- Where it fits in the academic paper structure
- Connection to disability studies literature on embodiment

---

## Quality Standards

- **Track all body passages**, not just meat-dismissal
- **Distinguish** what Case says from what Case experiences
- **Note the context** of each passage (state, situation)
- **Test both readings** (ideology and phenomenology) against evidence
- **Don't force ADHD parallels**—note resonance and divergence
- **Connect to Molly** preliminarily (full analysis in Task 3.2)

---

## Completion Criteria

This task is complete when:
- [ ] Body passage inventory is comprehensive (minimum 15 entries)
- [ ] Bodily signal table covers major signal types
- [ ] Category distribution is analysed
- [ ] ADHD resonance is assessed with appropriate caution
- [ ] Ideology vs. phenomenology argument is written
- [ ] Counter-reading is engaged
- [ ] Track C implications are noted

---

## Dependencies

**This task should follow:** Tasks 1.1, 1.2 (deprivation state and memory inform body analysis)

**This task feeds into:** Task 3.2 (Case vs. Molly comparison)

**This task is optional for:** Track B (standalone essay)

**This task is necessary for:** Track C (academic paper)
