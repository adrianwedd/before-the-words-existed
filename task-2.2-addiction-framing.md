# Research Task 2.2: Addiction Framing

## Phase 2 | Evidence Gathering | Priority: High

---

## The Strategic Claim

The SF formalist reviewer identified this as the task's highest-leverage finding:

> "Addiction operates in the novel as an *institutional misdescription*—a label that explains Case to systems that cannot represent functional mismatch."

That's a stronger claim than "Case isn't an addict." It reframes addiction not as a misdiagnosis but as a **category conflict**: institutions using moral/medical vocabulary because they lack the conceptual apparatus for access-dependent cognition.

This task gathers evidence to test whether the text supports that framing.

---

## Objective

Map how "addiction" language is deployed in *Neuromancer*—by whom, in what contexts, and whether Case's actual experience confirms or contradicts that framing.

The hypothesis:
- Institutions and external observers frame Case as an "addict"
- Case's lived experience does not match addiction phenomenology (craving → use → relief → crash → craving)
- Instead, his experience matches persistent deprivation (constant deficit, not cyclical craving)
- "Addiction" is therefore a category error—a moral-institutional label misapplied to functional need

**This task gathers evidence to test whether the text supports distinguishing addiction-framing from restoration-framing.**

---

## Scope

**Primary text:** Entire novel, focusing on:
- Any use of addiction-adjacent language
- The "punishment" backstory (how Case lost access)
- Restoration scene and aftermath
- Case's self-description of his longing

**Analytical scope:** Who speaks, when, and whether the narrator endorses

---

## Method

### Step 1: Addiction Language Inventory

Locate every use of addiction-adjacent terms:
- addict, addiction, addicted
- dependency, dependent
- craving, crave
- habit, hooked
- fix, need a fix
- withdrawal, withdrawing
- clean, sober
- any other drug/dependency vocabulary

Note: Include near-misses and circumlocutions.

### Step 2: Speaker Attribution

For each instance, identify:
- **Who says it:** Case (self-description), other character, narrator, institution
- **Context:** What prompts the usage
- **Tone:** Clinical, moral, neutral, ironic

### Step 3: Experience vs. Label Analysis

For each addiction-label, assess whether Case's actual experience (from Tasks 1.1, 1.2) matches or contradicts:

| Addiction Pattern | What It Looks Like | Does Case Show This? |
|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Cyclical craving | Wanting → using → relief → comedown → wanting again | |
| Tolerance escalation | Needing more over time for same effect | |
| Loss of control | Using despite intention not to | |
| Negative consequences ignored | Continued use despite harm | |
| Withdrawal as temporary | Symptoms fade with time | |
| Pleasure-seeking | Primary motivation is hedonic | |

vs.

| Deprivation Pattern | What It Looks Like | Does Case Show This? |
|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Persistent deficit | Constant absence, not cycling | |
| No escalation | Same need, same function | |
| Functional restoration | Use returns baseline, not high | |
| Withdrawal as permanent | Symptoms don't fade because need doesn't fade | |
| Coherence-seeking | Primary motivation is operational | |

### Step 4: The Restoration Test

When Case's access is restored, how does the text frame it?

| Frame | Markers |
|-------|---------|
| Getting high | Euphoria, rush, intensity, pleasure language |
| Coming home | Rightness, fit, coherence, function language |
| Relief | Tension release, relaxation, calm |
| Something else | Document what |

This is the critical test. If restoration reads as "getting high," the addiction frame has more purchase. If it reads as "coming home," the deprivation frame wins.

## Evidence Logging System

**Evidence IDs:** Use format `2.2-E01`, `2.2-E02`, etc.

**Voice Channel:** Tag each entry:
- **N** = Narrator | **FI** = Free indirect discourse | **D** = Dialogue

**Critical for this task:** Speaker attribution is everything. Who calls Case an addict matters as much as the language itself. D entries must note the speaker explicitly.

## Evidence Table: Addiction Language

| ID | Location | Term Used | Speaker | Context | Voice (N/FI/D) | Tone | Supported by Case's Experience? | Notes |
|----|----------|-----------|---------|---------|----------------|------|--------------------------------|-------|
| 2.2-E01 | | | | | | | | |
| 2.2-E02 | | | | | | | | |
| [Add rows as needed] | | | | | | | | |

## Evidence Table: Restoration Scene

| Marker Type | Present? | Quote/Paraphrase | Implication |
|-------------|----------|------------------|-------------|
| Euphoria/rush | | | |
| Pleasure language | | | |
| Rightness/fit | | | |
| Function/coherence | | | |
| Relief/calm | | | |
| Return-to-self | | | |
| Other | | | |

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **Does the narrator ever endorse "addiction" as the correct frame?**
   - Look for: narratorial judgment, not just character speech
   - Distinguish: narrator describing others' views vs. narrator asserting
   - This determines whether the text itself accepts the label

2. **Does Case ever call himself an addict? If so, how?**
   - Look for: self-application of addiction language
   - Note: self-description may be ironic, resigned, or internalized stigma
   - Distinguish: "I am an addict" (identity) vs. "they call me an addict" (label)

3. **Does Case's longing follow craving cycles or persistent deprivation?**
   - Craving cycle: peaks and troughs, temporary satisfaction
   - Persistent deprivation: constant, unsatisfied, not relieved even briefly
   - The pattern in Tasks 1.1 and 1.2 should inform this

4. **How is the punishment framed—as treating addiction or as enforcing compliance?**
   - Look for: medical language (treatment, cure) vs. punitive language (punishment, control)
   - This reveals whether the *text* treats Case's need as pathology or as leverage

5. **What does restoration feel like—intoxication or homecoming?**
   - This is the crux. Gather all markers from the restoration scene.
   - If ambiguous, note the ambiguity honestly.

## Counter-Reading to Engage

**The pro-addiction reading:** Case really is an addict. His self-serving narrative shouldn't be trusted. The novel (intentionally or not) romanticises dependency, and my reading is apologetics for self-destruction.

To address this:
- Acknowledge where addiction framing has textual support
- Distinguish: *moral* addiction (vice, weakness) vs. *clinical* addiction (brain disease) vs. *functional* dependency (need for access)
- Show where the text actively resists the addiction frame, not just where it can be alternatively read

---

## Argument Map Template

Create an argument map showing:

```
CLAIM: Case is an addict
├── Evidence FOR
│   ├── [Source 1: who says, what context]
│   ├── [Source 2: who says, what context]
│   └── [etc.]
├── Evidence AGAINST
│   ├── [Case's experience 1]
│   ├── [Case's experience 2]
│   └── [etc.]
└── ASSESSMENT: Supported / Complicated / Contradicted
```

- **Distinguish** narrator from characters
- **Test both frames** (addiction and deprivation) against evidence
- **Don't moralise** drug use—analyse how the text frames it
- **Acknowledge ambiguity** where the text doesn't resolve cleanly
- **Engage the counter-reading** seriously

---

## Completion Criteria

This task is complete when:
- [ ] Addiction language inventory has all instances located

- [ ] Experience vs. label tables show clear pattern (or documented ambiguity)
- [ ] Restoration scene is analysed in detail
- [ ] Argument map is constructed
- [ ] Synthesis is written
- [ ] Counter-reading is engaged

---

## Dependencies

**This task should follow:** Tasks 1.1 and 1.2 (Case's experience is the test against the label)

**This task must be completed before:** Drafting Section 3

**This task can run in parallel with:** Tasks 2.1 and 2.3

---

## Note on Ethical Framing

This analysis does not endorse or condemn drug use. It asks:
- How does the *text* frame Case's relationship to the Matrix?
- Is "addiction" an accurate description or a misapplied category?
- What political/moral work does the label do within the narrative?

The goal is analytical clarity, not moral positioning.
