# Research Task 2.2: Addiction Framing

## Phase 2 | Evidence Gathering | Priority: High

---

## The Strategic Claim

The SF formalist reviewer identified this as the task's highest-leverage finding:

> "Addiction operates in the novel as an *institutional misdescription*—a label that explains Case to systems that cannot represent functional mismatch."

That's a stronger claim than "Case isn't an addict." It reframes addiction not as a misdiagnosis but as a **category conflict**: institutions using moral/medical vocabulary because they lack the conceptual apparatus for access-dependent cognition.

This task gathers evidence to test whether the text supports that framing.

---

## Objective

Map how "addiction" language is deployed in *Neuromancer*—by whom, in what contexts, and whether Case's actual experience confirms or contradicts that framing.

The hypothesis:
- Institutions and external observers frame Case as an "addict"
- Case's lived experience does not match addiction phenomenology (craving → use → relief → crash → craving)
- Instead, his experience matches persistent deprivation (constant deficit, not cyclical craving)
- "Addiction" is therefore a category error—a moral-institutional label misapplied to functional need

**This task gathers evidence to test whether the text supports distinguishing addiction-framing from restoration-framing.**

---

## Scope

**Primary text:** Entire novel, focusing on:
- Any use of addiction-adjacent language
- The "punishment" backstory (how Case lost access)
- Restoration scene and aftermath
- Case's self-description of his longing

**Analytical scope:** Who speaks, when, and whether the narrator endorses

---

## Method

### Step 1: Addiction Language Inventory

Locate every use of addiction-adjacent terms:
- addict, addiction, addicted
- dependency, dependent
- craving, crave
- habit, hooked
- fix, need a fix
- withdrawal, withdrawing
- clean, sober
- any other drug/dependency vocabulary

Note: Include near-misses and circumlocutions.

### Step 2: Speaker Attribution

For each instance, identify:
- **Who says it:** Case (self-description), other character, narrator, institution
- **Context:** What prompts the usage
- **Tone:** Clinical, moral, neutral, ironic

### Step 3: Experience vs. Label Analysis

For each addiction-label, assess whether Case's actual experience (from Tasks 1.1, 1.2) matches or contradicts:

| Addiction Pattern | What It Looks Like | Does Case Show This? |
|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Cyclical craving | Wanting → using → relief → comedown → wanting again | |
| Tolerance escalation | Needing more over time for same effect | |
| Loss of control | Using despite intention not to | |
| Negative consequences ignored | Continued use despite harm | |
| Withdrawal as temporary | Symptoms fade with time | |
| Pleasure-seeking | Primary motivation is hedonic | |

vs.

| Deprivation Pattern | What It Looks Like | Does Case Show This? |
|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Persistent deficit | Constant absence, not cycling | |
| No escalation | Same need, same function | |
| Functional restoration | Use returns baseline, not high | |
| Withdrawal as permanent | Symptoms don't fade because need doesn't fade | |
| Coherence-seeking | Primary motivation is operational | |

### Step 4: The Restoration Test

When Case's access is restored, how does the text frame it?

| Frame | Markers |
|-------|---------|
| Getting high | Euphoria, rush, intensity, pleasure language |
| Coming home | Rightness, fit, coherence, function language |
| Relief | Tension release, relaxation, calm |
| Something else | Document what |

This is the critical test. If restoration reads as "getting high," the addiction frame has more purchase. If it reads as "coming home," the deprivation frame wins.

## Evidence Logging System

**Evidence IDs:** Use format `2.2-E01`, `2.2-E02`, etc.

**Voice Channel:** Tag each entry:
- **N** = Narrator | **FI** = Free indirect discourse | **D** = Dialogue

**Critical for this task:** Speaker attribution is everything. Who calls Case an addict matters as much as the language itself. D entries must note the speaker explicitly.

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **Does the narrator ever endorse "addiction" as the correct frame?**
   - Look for: narratorial judgment, not just character speech
   - Distinguish: narrator describing others' views vs. narrator asserting
   - This determines whether the text itself accepts the label

2. **Does Case ever call himself an addict? If so, how?**
   - Look for: self-application of addiction language
   - Note: self-description may be ironic, resigned, or internalized stigma
   - Distinguish: "I am an addict" (identity) vs. "they call me an addict" (label)

3. **Does Case's longing follow craving cycles or persistent deprivation?**
   - Craving cycle: peaks and troughs, temporary satisfaction
   - Persistent deprivation: constant, unsatisfied, not relieved even briefly
   - The pattern in Tasks 1.1 and 1.2 should inform this

4. **How is the punishment framed—as treating addiction or as enforcing compliance?**
   - Look for: medical language (treatment, cure) vs. punitive language (punishment, control)
   - This reveals whether the *text* treats Case's need as pathology or as leverage

5. **What does restoration feel like—intoxication or homecoming?**
   - This is the crux. Gather all markers from the restoration scene.
   - If ambiguous, note the ambiguity honestly.

---

## Counter-Reading to Engage

**The pro-addiction reading:** Case really is an addict. His self-serving narrative shouldn't be trusted. The novel (intentionally or not) romanticises dependency, and my reading is apologetics for self-destruction.

To address this:
- Acknowledge where addiction framing has textual support
- Distinguish: *moral* addiction (vice, weakness) vs. *clinical* addiction (brain disease) vs. *functional* dependency (need for access)
- Show where the text actively resists the addiction frame, not just where it can be alternatively read

## Second-Pass Note

Patterns did not shift; they deepened. New entries add explicit stimulant language (cocaine/amphetamine, betaphenethylamine rush and hangover) and third-party dependence (Riviera), reinforcing that addiction vocabulary is broad but unevenly applied to Case's matrix need.

## Synthesis (300-400 words)

Addiction language in *Neuromancer* is present but unevenly distributed. The narrator uses addiction explicitly for Linda ("armature of addiction") and for Zone ("slow undersea grace of his addiction"), but this vocabulary is rarely applied directly to Case by the narrator. Institutional voices do label him: Deane greets him as "clean," and Armitage frames medical intervention as freeing him from a "dangerous dependency." Case himself adopts addiction language later, telling Cath "I'm a drug addict" and explicitly seeking to "buzz" and "get high." These are unambiguous drug-seeking lines and must be granted weight.

However, Case's core longing for the Matrix is rendered as persistent, functional deprivation rather than a cyclical craving loop. The early Chiba passage stresses constant absence and a phantom-limb reach for the console, with no relief cycles. The memory is operational and intact; he does not describe needing more over time or losing control in a use/comedown pattern. When access is restored, the scene combines euphoria with homecoming: "distanceless home, his country," tears of release, and immediate operational coherence. This reads less like intoxication as escape and more like a return to a baseline mode of competence. That combination is crucial: the text allows affective intensity without making the experience primarily hedonic.

The strongest support for the "institutional misdescription" claim lies in who says what. The most formal addiction language ("dangerous dependency") is instrumental and controlling, used to leverage Case's labor; it does not describe his phenomenology. Meanwhile, Case's own stimulant use is real and acknowledged, but it sits alongside a distinct, functional dependency on matrix access. The text therefore supports a category conflict: drug addiction exists in the world (and in Case), yet the deprivation of interface competence is not reducible to addiction cycles. The addiction frame fits some behaviors but does not fully map his core loss.

## Counter-Reading Response

The pro-addiction reading is right to point to explicit drug-seeking ("I wanna buzz") and self-label ("I'm a drug addict"). The novel does not deny Case's stimulant abuse, and those moments are not ironic. Where the pro-addiction reading fails is in collapsing all of Case's deprivation into that frame. The matrix loss is rendered as a persistent, functional absence with procedural memory intact, not as a craving/relief cycle. The restoration scene mixes euphoria with homecoming and operational coherence, which is a different structure than drug intoxication alone. The most formal addiction framing comes from institutions that benefit from describing his need as dependency, suggesting moral/medical labeling where functional access is at stake.

## Implications for Section 3 Draft

Claims to make:
- Addiction language is present but primarily applied to others or used instrumentally by institutions.
- Case's stimulant use is real and must be acknowledged.
- Matrix longing reads as persistent deprivation and functional need, not a classic addiction cycle.

Claims to qualify:
- Restoration includes euphoria; avoid framing it as purely calm or purely technical.
- Case's self-label as addict complicates any simple rejection of addiction framing.

Load-bearing moments:
- Deane's "clean," Armitage's "dangerous dependency," Case's "drug addict" line.
- Restoration: "distanceless home, his country," "tears of release."

Handling moral complexity:
- Distinguish drug addiction (hedonic, cyclical) from access-dependency (functional, persistent).
- Treat institutional framing as leverage rather than phenomenological truth.

---

## Note on Ethical Framing

This analysis does not endorse or condemn drug use. It asks:
- How does the *text* frame Case's relationship to the Matrix?
- Is "addiction" an accurate description or a misapplied category?
- What political/moral work does the label do within the narrative?

The goal is analytical clarity, not moral positioning.
