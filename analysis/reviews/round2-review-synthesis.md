# Round 2 Adversarial Review Synthesis: Hardened Track C Draft

## Survivability Spread

| Reviewer | Rating | Verdict |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Claude | 78% | "Argument survives adversarial review" |
| Gemini | 65% | "Wounds the argument" — unfalsifiability remains |
| Deepseek | 65% | "Wounds the argument" — unfalsifiability remains |
| ChatGPT | 55% | "Historical scaffold is unreliable" — **catches factual errors** |
| Gemini-cli | 90% | "Pacified" — ready for submission |

**Mean: 71%** (up from 57%)
**Spread: 35 percentage points** — significant divergence

**Notable convergence:** Gemini and Deepseek independently arrived at 65% with nearly identical critiques (unfalsifiability, two-dependency vulnerability). This strengthens those findings.

## The Divergence Matters

The split is not random. It tracks disciplinary orientation:

| Reviewer | Orientation | Satisfied? |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Claude | Generalist / literary | Yes |
| Gemini-cli | Generalist / literary | Yes |
| Gemini | Theory-heavy | Partial |
| Deepseek | Theory-heavy | Partial |
| ChatGPT | Fact-checking / historical | **No** |

**The historical scaffold is the fault line.**

## Historical Verification Results

ChatGPT flagged potential errors. Verification results:

### 1. Utah Criteria Dating

**Essay claims:** "Wender et al., 1980s"

**Verified timeline:**
- **1976**: Wood, Reimherr & Wender published foundational paper "Diagnosis and treatment of minimal brain dysfunction in adults" — this established the Utah Criteria
- **1980s**: Wender continued research and publications
- **1993**: Ward, Wender & Reimherr published the formal Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS)

**Verdict:** Essay's "1980s" is **imprecise but defensible**. The criteria existed from 1976 and were being refined through the 1980s. The formalized rating scale wasn't published until 1993.

**Recommended fix:** Change reference to:
> "Wender et al. (Wood et al. 1976; Ward et al. 1993). Utah Criteria, proposed 1976, rating scale formalized 1993."

---

### 2. Mike Oliver Citation

**Essay claims:** "Oliver, 1983. 'The Individual and Social Models of Disability.' Paper presented at Thames Polytechnic."

**Verified:**
- **1981**: Oliver coined "social model of disability" in a contribution to *The Handicapped Person* (ed. Campling)
- **1983**: Oliver published *Social Work with Disabled People* (book, Macmillan)
- **1990**: Oliver presented "The Individual and Social Models of Disability" at Thames Polytechnic — **this is the paper cited, but it's from 1990, not 1983**

**Verdict:** Essay's citation is **wrong**. The specific paper was presented in July 1990.

**Required fix:** Either:
- Change to: "Oliver, 1990. 'The Individual and Social Models of Disability.' Paper presented at Thames Polytechnic."
- Or cite the 1983 book: "Oliver, 1983. *Social Work with Disabled People*. Macmillan."

---

### Impact on "Before the Words Existed" Claim

The historical spine is **not demolished** but needs tightening:

- The essay's claim that vocabulary was "fragmented" in 1984 remains defensible
- Wender's adult ADHD work did exist in research contexts by 1984 (since 1976)
- Oliver's social model terminology existed by 1983
- The "naming gap" is real but should be framed as "fragmentation" not "absence"

**ChatGPT was right to flag these.** A fact-checking reviewer would catch the Oliver error. Fix it before submission.

## What the Hostile Reviewers Still Want

Even at 65%, Gemini and Deepseek identify remaining vulnerabilities:

1. **Two-dependency model still looks like special pleading** — "conflation" is better than "misdescription" but the protected category for matrix-longing remains
2. **Gender noted but not integrated** — "This omission lets your analysis remain in a gender-neutral vacuum"
3. **Marxist reading acknowledged but not allowed to challenge** — "You merely add it as a 'compatible' macro layer, avoiding the harder question"
4. **Media-ecology reading unengaged** — McLuhan's "external nervous system" as alternative to cognitive mismatch

ChatGPT (55%) adds:

5. **Historical scaffold unreliable** — if dates are wrong, the "naming gap" collapses
6. **Phenomenology cosplay continues** — "experiential-structural" is cosmetic, not substantive
7. **Evidence log is "authority theater"** — Task IDs without auditable data

---

## What the Satisfied Reviewers Accept

Claude (78%) and Gemini-cli (90%) accept:

1. The "experiential-structural" reframe as honest
2. The "conflation" language as defensible
3. The "scale shift" framing as appropriately humble
4. The Marxist integration as strategic co-optation
5. The gender acknowledgment as necessary protection
6. The death-drive alternative as good faith concession

**Key difference:** These reviewers are literary scholars. They accept the genre conventions of close reading. The hostile reviewers (theory-heavy, fact-checking) apply external standards.

---

## The Decision Point

The essay is in a defensible position for **literary venues** (71-90% survivability).

It remains vulnerable to **theory-heavy or historically rigorous venues** (55-65% survivability).

**The historical errors are the critical variable.** If the Utah Criteria and Oliver dates are wrong, the "before the words existed" claim is damaged — and that's the title and spine of the essay.

## Recommended Actions

### MUST DO (before any submission)

1. **Fix the duplicate paragraph** in §5 (lines 74-75) — copy-paste artifact
2. **Fix Oliver citation** — change from 1983 to 1990 (VERIFIED: the Thames Polytechnic paper was July 1990)
3. **Tighten Utah Criteria reference** — change "Wender et al., 1980s" to cite specific publications (Wood et al. 1976; Ward et al. 1993)

### SHOULD DO (for theory-heavy venues)

4. **Add one falsification example** to §7 — specify what textual evidence would disprove the two-dependency model
5. **Expand gender integration** — one paragraph on how masculinity shapes mismatch perception
6. **Engage media-ecology reading** — one sentence acknowledging McLuhan as alternative frame

### OPTIONAL (for maximum hardening)

7. **Cut or shorten §10 (PKD)** — highest exposure-to-payoff ratio
8. **Add one lived-experience citation** — Hallowell & Ratey or similar
9. **Add one addiction-phenomenology citation** — Marc Lewis to distinguish hedonic from identity-bound craving

---

## Final Assessment

**The hardening pass worked.** The essay moved from ~57% to ~71% mean survivability. The core close reading is defensible, the scaffolding is tightened, and the counter-readings are engaged.

**Historical verification complete:**
- Utah Criteria: Essay's "1980s" claim is imprecise but defensible (work began 1976, continued through 1980s, formalized 1993)
- Oliver citation: **Wrong** — the Thames Polytechnic paper was 1990, not 1983. Must fix.

**The essay is ready for literary venues** after fixing:
1. Oliver citation (1990, not 1983)
2. Utah Criteria reference (add specific dates)
3. Duplicate paragraph in §5

**For theory-heavy venues**, additional hardening recommended (falsification examples, gender integration, media-ecology acknowledgment).
