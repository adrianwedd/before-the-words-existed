# Peer Review Report: "Before the Words Existed"

**Review Status:** MAJOR REVISIONS REQUIRED
**Tone:** Hostile / Adversarial

This draft is a frustrating mixture of sharp observation and methodological sleight-of-hand. You have identified a genuine pattern in *Neuromancer* (the operational shift between interface and flesh), but you have dressed it up in a "lab coat" of pseudo-empiricism to hide the fact that you are effectively re-diagnosing a fictional character while claiming you aren't.

The "mismatch" framework is useful, but the "pre-clinical sensing" hypothesis borders on mystical, and your dismissal of previous critics is unearned. You are not discovering a new continent; you are just renaming the soil.

Here is the breakdown from three distinct theoretical angles.

---

## 1. Reviewer A: The Phenomenology Purist

*Perspective: Continental Philosophy / Husserlian Phenomenology*

**The Strongest Objection:**
You are confusing **phenomenology** (the first-person description of the structure of consciousness) with **functionalism** (how a system operates). Your "mismatch" is not a phenomenological category; it is an engineering one. You claim to be mapping Case's *experience*, but you are actually mapping his *competence*. Case feels alienation in the meat and competence in the matrix; that is a banal observation about skill, not a revelation about the structure of consciousness. You have not shown us a "phenomenology of mismatch"; you have shown us a narrative about a workman who lost his tools.

**Supporting Pressure Points:**

* **The "Phantom Limb" Metaphor:** You use this loosely to mean "missing a tool." A true phenomenological phantom limb involves the retention of the *schema* of the limb in the body image. Case doesn't feel a "phantom console"; he feels the *absence* of the console. This distinction is crucial and you gloss over it.
* **"Reversibility" as a Metric:** You treat "reversibility" as a phenomenological proof. It isn't. It's a plot mechanic. The fact that Case's mood changes when he jacks in is narrative cause-and-effect, not a structural feature of his consciousness.
* **The "Pre-Clinical Sensing" Hypothesis:** This is unfalsifiable literary mysticism. You claim the text "preserves an experience." Where does it preserve it? In the ink? Experience requires a subject. Case is not a subject; he is a textual object. You are projecting a clinical schema onto a set of linguistic cues and calling it "sensing."

**The Steelman Version:**
A defender would argue that in a novel, the only access we have to "consciousness" is through the representation of function and affect. Therefore, describing the *shift* in functional competence *is* describing the phenomenology of that character. The "phantom limb" is not a literal limb, but a "phantom agency"—the retention of a mode of being that has no outlet.

**Verdict:**
**Wounds the argument.** You need to drop the pretentious "lab coat" claim. You are doing close reading, not phenomenology. Acknowledge that you are analyzing *narrative representation of cognition*, not cognition itself.

## 2. Reviewer B: The Disability Studies Skeptic

*Perspective: Critical Disability Studies / Neurodiversity Theory*

**The Strongest Objection:**
Your "Two-Dependency Model" (Section 7) is a transparent attempt to sanitize your protagonist. You want Case to be "neurodivergent" (noble, misunderstood, interface-dependent) rather than a "junkie" (pathological, dependent). By splitting his addiction into "dirty" drug dependency and "clean" access-dependency, you are engaging in the very stigmatization you claim to critique. You are effectively saying, "He isn't an addict; he's just *wired differently*." This ignores the reality that for many neurodivergent people, the "interface" *is* the addiction. You are trying to save the "cool" cyberpunk aesthetic from the messy reality of dependence.

**Supporting Pressure Points:**

* **The "Superpower" Trap:** In Section 11, you explicitly deny that mismatch is a superpower. But your entire argument rests on the fact that when Case is plugged in, he is a god-tier operator. If the "cure" for his mismatch is becoming the best hacker in the Sprawl, you *are* romanticizing the condition.
* **Institutional Misdescription:** You argue that Armitage and Deane "misdescribe" Case's need as addiction. This is a "No True Scotsman" fallacy. If the text says he's addicted, you say it's "institutional framing." If the text says he's competent, you say it's "phenomenological proof." You have rigged the game so that all negative traits are external imposition and all positive traits are innate neurotype.
* **Erasure of Suffering:** You focus heavily on "operational coherence." You minimize the *pain* of the deprivation state, reducing it to "attritional flattening." This clinical detachment erases the affective reality of the text: Case is miserable.

**The Steelman Version:**
The essay argues that the *text itself* distinguishes between the drug high (cyclical, crashing) and the matrix high (procedural, competence-building). The author isn't sanitizing Case; they are pointing out that *Neuromancer* portrays two different kinds of loops. One destroys agency; the other restores it.

**Verdict:**
**Wounds the ethical framing.** The distinction between "good" access and "bad" addiction is too clean. You need to admit that the "interface-dependency" is *also* a pathology in the context of the novel, not just a misunderstood cognitive style.

## 3. Reviewer C: The SF Formalist / Genre Specialist

*Perspective: Cyberpunk Scholarship / Marxist Criticism*

**The Strongest Objection:**
The "Naming Gap" (Section 9) is an act of supreme arrogance. You claim Jameson, Hayles, and Bukatman "sensed but could not name" this phenomenon. Nonsense. Jameson named it *schizophrenia* (the breakdown of the signifying chain). Bukatman named it *terminal identity* (the dissolution of the subject at the interface). You are not identifying a gap; you are simply refusing to translate their vocabulary into yours. You are replacing rigorous theoretical concepts (postmodern fragmentation) with a trendy, clinically-adjacent buzzword ("mismatch"). You haven't proven they were wrong; you've just proven you prefer 2024 language to 1994 language.

**Supporting Pressure Points:**

* **Strawmanning the Noir Reading:** You treat the "noir" reading as merely "atmospheric." This is a profound misreading of noir. Noir is *structural*. It is about the entrapment of the subject by forces they cannot control. Case's "deprivation" is a standard noir trope: the down-and-out detective. You are over-reading a genre convention as a neurocognitive event.
* **The Molly Contrast:** You treat Molly as a "controlled experiment." She is not. She is a genre foil—the "razorgirl." Contrasting the "mind guy" with the "body girl" is the oldest trope in the book. It does not prove "relational cognition"; it proves Gibson read Chandler and comic books.
* **Mechanism vs. Metaphor:** You insist the body is "not a metaphor." In fiction, *everything* is a metaphor. Case's "prison of flesh" is a Gnostic metaphor, a Catholic metaphor, and a Cartesian metaphor. Flattening it to "interoceptive mismatch" robs the text of its symbolic weight.

**The Steelman Version:**
While previous critics identified the *fragmentation*, they attributed it to the *cultural logic of capitalism* (Jameson) or *technology in general* (Bukatman). This essay specifies the mechanism: it is not general fragmentation, but specific, reversible, interface-dependent switching. That specificity is new.

**Verdict:**
**Kills the novelty claim.** You must walk back the idea that earlier critics "missed" this. They framed it differently. Frame your argument as a *refinement* of Bukatman, not a discovery of what he missed.

## 4. Additional Attacks

### Methodological Critique

**The "Evidence Log" is Performative.**
Citing "Task IDs" and "Evidence IDs" (e.g., `1.1-E01`) in the footnotes is theatrical. Unless you provide the raw dataset and the coding schema, these are just magic numbers meant to intimidate the reader with the *aesthetic* of data science. It contradicts your claim to be doing "phenomenology." Are you a philosopher or a database manager? Pick one. This looks like "physics envy."

### Historical Critique

**The "Residual Type" Fallacy.**
You lean heavily on the idea that ADD "Residual Type" was a shadow category in 1980. While technically true, you overstate the "naming gap." The concept of the "hyperactive adult" was well-known in pop psychology (e.g., the "Type A" personality overlap). You are forcing a teleology where 1984 is a dark age waiting for the light of Neurodiversity. The cultural conversation was messier and richer than your binary suggests.

### Rhetorical Critique

**The "Lab Coat" Tone.**
Phrases like "keeps the lab coat on," "the collar is up," and "the proof is not in a single scene but in reversibility" are defensive and posturing. They suggest you are afraid your argument can't stand on its own merits, so you have to roleplay as a hard-boiled detective/scientist. It is distracting. Cut the meta-commentary on your own "rigor" and just *be* rigorous.

### The Missing Counter-Reading

**The "Capitalist Realism" / Labor Power Reading.**
The most glaring omission is the Marxist reading (e.g., Mark Fisher or Franco "Bifo" Berardi). Case's "mismatch" is not a neurotype; it is the condition of the **cognitive proletariat**. His nervous system has been modified to be a production unit. When he is not producing (jacking in), he is useless to capital, and therefore useless to himself. The "deprivation" is not a lack of interface; it is **unemployment**. By framing this as "neurodivergence," you depoliticize it. You turn a story about the exploitation of the nervous system into a story about "finding your groove."

## 5. Final Verdict

**Survivability Rating: 60%**
The core observation—that Case's cognition is state-dependent and interface-specific—is strong and textually supported. However, the theoretical scaffolding you have built around it (pre-clinical sensing, the naming gap, the faux-empiricism) is rickety and will collapse under scrutiny.

**Fatal Flaw:**
**The Depoliticization of the Interface.** You treat the matrix as a neutral "affordance" that Case's brain just *happens* to fit. You ignore that the matrix is a corporate construct designed to extract labor. Case's "fit" is the fit of a cog in a machine, not a hand in a glove. Ignoring this makes your "mismatch" theory naively functionalist.

**Recommended Revision Priority:**

1. **Drop the "Evidence ID" theater.** It undermines your credibility as a literary critic.
2. **Engage the Marxist/Labor reading.** You must address *why* Case is wired this way (because he is a worker).
3. **Humble the "Naming Gap."** Acknowledge Jameson and Bukatman as correct *on their own terms*, and position your reading as a granular addition, not a replacement.
4. **Kill the "Lab Coat" persona.** Write like a scholar, not a noir detective narrator.

The essay has a beating heart, but it is currently buried under layers of defensive armor. Strip it down.
