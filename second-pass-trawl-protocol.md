# Systematic Trawl Protocol: Second Pass

## Purpose

The first pass established patterns and validated core claims. This second pass aims for **exhaustive coverage** suitable for Track C peer review.

Goal: When a reviewer asks "Did you check [X]?", the answer is always "Yes, see entry [ID]."

---

## General Method

1. **Work from a searchable text file** of *Neuromancer*
2. **Run keyword searches** for each evidence category
3. **Audit chapter-by-chapter** to catch what keywords miss
4. **Log everything** — even if it's a near-miss or explicitly excluded
5. **Update evidence tables** with new entries using continuing IDs (1.1-E19, etc.)

---

## Task 1.1: Deprivation State — Second Pass

### Current Coverage
- 18 evidence entries + 3 counterexamples
- Primarily Chapter 1

### Gap Risk
Later chapters may contain flashbacks, references, or comparisons to the deprivation period that deepen or complicate the pattern.

### Keyword Searches

**Affective flatness (AF):**
```
flat, numb, empty, dead, nothing, didn't care, indifferent, hollow
```

**World as noise (WN):**
```
noise, hum, blur, crowd, swarm, static, buzz, meaningless
```

**Purposeless alertness (PA):**
```
alert, awake, wired, jittery, nervous, twitch, sweat, couldn't sleep
```

**Tractionlessness (TR):**
```
stuck, nowhere, pointless, useless, didn't matter, waste, spin
```

**Temporal accumulation (TA):**
```
day, week, month, year, waiting, endless, long, drag, slow
```

**Body as luggage (BL):**
```
meat, flesh, body, prison, weight, drag, carry, burden
```

### Chapter Audit

| Chapter | Relevant to 1.1? | Checked? | New Entries? |
|---------|------------------|----------|--------------|
| 1 (Chiba City) | Primary | ✓ First pass | Verify complete |
| 2 (Armitage/Molly) | Transitional | | |
| 3 (Arena) | Pre-restoration | | |
| 4 (Restoration) | Contrast point | | |
| 5-7 | Post-restoration refs? | | |
| 8-12 | Flashbacks? | | |
| 13-24 | Comparisons? | | |

### Specific Hunts

1. **Later references to Chiba period** — Characters or narrator looking back
2. **Simstim sequences** — Does Case experience Molly's body differently than his own?
3. **Dream sequences** — Temporal/body phenomenology in dreams
4. **Post-restoration contrasts** — Moments where restored state is explicitly compared to deprivation

---

## Task 1.2: Sharp Memory — Second Pass

### Current Coverage
- 8 memory passages
- **This is the thinnest inventory**

### Gap Risk
High. 8 passages for a 270-page novel where Matrix memory is thematically central. Likely missing 50%+ of relevant material.

### Keyword Searches

**Matrix memory/reference:**
```
matrix, cyberspace, jack, deck, console, cowboy, ice, data, grid, 
lattice, light, void, bodiless, flatline, ROM, construct
```

**Memory/recall language:**
```
remember, remembered, memory, dream, dreamed, knew, used to, 
before, once, back when
```

**Procedural/technical:**
```
program, code, ice, intrusion, penetrate, system, corporate, 
Sense/Net, run, operation
```

### Chapter Audit

| Chapter | Matrix Memory Present? | Checked? | New Entries? |
|---------|----------------------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | Yes (primary) | ✓ First pass | Verify complete |
| 2 | Likely | | |
| 3 | Arena — anticipation | ✓ Partial | |
| 4 | Restoration — contrast | ✓ Partial | |
| 5-7 | Active runs — refs back? | | |
| 8-12 | Dixie Flatline sequences | | |
| 13-24 | Late-novel refs? | | |

### Specific Hunts

1. **Dixie Flatline interactions** — ROM construct may trigger Case's memories
2. **Anticipation scenes** — Moments before jacking in where memory surfaces
3. **Teaching/explaining moments** — Case explaining Matrix to others reveals his knowledge structure
4. **Comparison moments** — "This was like..." or "Not like before..."
5. **Dreams** — Dreams of Matrix should be inventoried separately

### Quality Check
For each entry, verify:
- [ ] Detail level assessed (High/Medium/Low)
- [ ] Procedural content tagged
- [ ] Tone tagged (Cold/Neutral/Warm)
- [ ] Language precision noted
- [ ] Idealisation assessed

---

## Task 2.1: Time Phenomenology — Second Pass

### Current Coverage
- 15 temporal markers across states

### Gap Risk
Moderate. Time language is pervasive in prose. Likely missing significant texture, especially in ACT (active Matrix) and OUT (post-restoration meatspace) states.

### Keyword Searches

**Explicit duration:**
```
hour, minute, second, day, week, month, year, time, long, short
```

**Subjective duration:**
```
felt like, seemed, endless, forever, instant, suddenly, before I knew
```

**Urgency/pressure:**
```
hurry, rush, deadline, quick, fast, now, wait, waiting
```

**Flow/absorption:**
```
lost track, forgot, hours later, didn't notice, absorbed, deep
```

**Future orientation:**
```
tomorrow, soon, later, will, going to, plan, next, after
```

### State-by-State Audit

| State | Current Entries | Target | Gap |
|-------|-----------------|--------|-----|
| DEP (Deprivation) | 5 | 8-10 | ~3-5 |
| MEM (Memory) | 1 | 3-5 | ~2-4 |
| RES (Restoration) | 2 | 3-4 | ~1-2 |
| ACT (Active Matrix) | 6 | 10-15 | ~4-9 |
| OUT (Post-restore meat) | 1 | 5-8 | ~4-7 |
| TRN (Transition) | 0 | 3-5 | ~3-5 |

**Biggest gaps:** ACT and OUT states need more coverage.

### Specific Hunts

1. **Straylight sequence** — Extended real-time action, rich in temporal markers
2. **Freeside chapters** — Mixed meat/Matrix, good for OUT state
3. **Operation planning** — Deadlines, countdowns, external time structure
4. **Simstim switches** — Temporal experience when switching perspectives

---

## Task 2.2: Addiction Framing — Second Pass

### Current Coverage
- 9 addiction-language entries

### Gap Risk
Low to moderate. Addiction vocabulary is specific and finite. But may be missing:
- Circumlocutions (need, crave, want, have to)
- Institutional language beyond Armitage/Deane
- Case's internal longing language that doesn't use explicit addiction terms

### Keyword Searches

**Explicit addiction terms:**
```
addict, addiction, addicted, drug, drugs, fix, habit, hooked, 
clean, sober, dependency, dependent, withdrawal, craving
```

**Near-addiction language:**
```
need, needed, crave, craved, want, wanted, have to, couldn't stop,
couldn't help, compulsion, urge, itch
```

**Substance references:**
```
dex, octagon, amphetamine, stimulant, betaphenethylamine, derms,
drunk, high, buzz, wired
```

### Speaker Audit

| Speaker Category | Current | Verify Complete? |
|------------------|---------|------------------|
| Narrator on Case | 0 direct | Verify |
| Narrator on others | 3 (Linda, Zone) | Verify |
| Case self-description | 3 | Hunt for more |
| Armitage/employers | 2 | Verify complete |
| Molly | 1 | Hunt for more |
| Other characters | 0 | Hunt |

### Specific Hunts

1. **Wintermute's framing of Case** — How does the AI describe his needs?
2. **3Jane/Tessier-Ashpool** — Any institutional language about Case?
3. **Case's internal monologue** — Longing language that might not use "addiction"
4. **Comparisons to other users** — How does Case compare to explicit addicts?

---

## Task 2.3: Environmental Markers — Second Pass

### Current Coverage
- 9 attribution entries
- 4-environment affordance map

### Gap Risk
Moderate to high. The affordance map is thin. Many environments not yet catalogued:
- Freeside
- Straylight
- The Finn's place
- JAL shuttle
- Istanbul
- Various Matrix locations (Sense/Net, Rio, etc.)

### Keyword Searches

**Attribution language:**
```
broken, damaged, wrong, fault, couldn't, unable, failed, lost,
blocked, denied, locked, cut off, severed
```

**Access language:**
```
access, interface, jack, connect, reach, enter, open, available
```

**Environment descriptors:**
```
place, space, world, city, street, room, matrix, meat, flesh
```

**Fit/mismatch language:**
```
fit, belong, home, country, foreign, alien, wrong place, right place
```

### Environment Audit

| Environment | In Affordance Map? | Evidence Entries? |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Chiba City | ✓ | Expand |
| Night City (general) | Partial | Add |
| Chatsubo bar | No | Add |
| Coffin hotel | No | Add |
| Matrix (general) | ✓ | Expand |
| Matrix (Sense/Net) | No | Add |
| Matrix (Rio) | No | Add |
| Matrix (Straylight) | No | Add |
| Freeside | No | Add |
| Straylight Villa | No | Add |
| The Finn's | No | Add |
| BAMA sprawl | No | Add |
| Simstim (Molly's body) | No | Add |

### Specific Hunts

1. **Every named location** — What does it afford/deny Case?
2. **Simstim as environment** — Being in Molly's body is a distinct environmental experience
3. **Construct space** — The beach, Neuromancer's world
4. **Transition moments** — Jacking in/out, what changes?

---

## Cross-Task Synthesis Opportunities

As you trawl, watch for passages that serve multiple tasks:

| Passage Type | Relevant Tasks |
|--------------|----------------|
| Dreams of Matrix | 1.1, 1.2, 2.1 |
| Jacking in/out | 1.2, 2.1, 2.3 |
| Drug use scenes | 1.1, 2.2 |
| Simstim switches | 1.1, 2.1, 2.3 |
| Dixie Flatline | 1.2, 2.1 |
| Armitage/Wintermute directives | 2.2, 2.3 |

---

## Deliverables for Second Pass

### Per Task:
1. **Updated evidence table** with new entries (continuing IDs)
2. **Chapter audit checklist** marked complete
3. **Keyword search log** — which terms searched, results
4. **New counterexamples** if found
5. **Pattern stability assessment** — Did findings change or just deepen?

### Overall:
1. **Coverage report** — % of novel systematically checked
2. **Evidence density map** — Where are clusters? Where are gaps?
3. **Confidence upgrade** — Which claims can now be stated more strongly?

## Recommended Workflow

**Option A: Task-by-task**
Complete second pass on 1.1, then 1.2, then 2.1, etc.
- Pro: Deep focus
- Con: Multiple passes through same chapters

**Option B: Chapter-by-chapter**
Read each chapter once, tagging for all tasks simultaneously.
- Pro: Efficient, catches cross-task passages
- Con: Requires multi-tracking

**Option C: Keyword sweep first, then chapter audit**
Run all keyword searches, then read chapters to catch what keywords missed.
- Pro: Fast keyword pass, targeted reading
- Con: May miss context-dependent evidence

**Recommendation:** Option C for efficiency, with Option B as cleanup for chapters with high keyword density.
