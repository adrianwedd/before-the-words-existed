# Repository Guidelines

## Project Summary
This repository is a research workspace for the essay project "Neuromancer ADHD Phenomenology." Work is organized as discrete task files that must be completed using close reading of `Neuromancer.md` and the task instructions in this root folder.

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- Primary source text: `Neuromancer.md`
- Task briefs and outputs: `task-*.md` (e.g., `task-2.1-time-phenomenology.md`)
- Method reference: `methodological-posture.md`
- Reference-only summary: `README.md`
- Quarantined material: `synthesis-notes/` (do not open until Phase 2 is complete)

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
There is no build system or automated test suite in this repository. Work is done by editing the task Markdown files directly.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Use Markdown headings and tables as defined in each task brief.
- Evidence IDs must follow the task pattern: `1.1-E01`, `1.2-X03`, etc.
- Voice tags must be one of `N`, `FI`, or `D`.
- Keep prose concise and specific; prefer direct quotes or tight paraphrases.

Example evidence ID: `2.1-E07`

## Testing Guidelines
Not applicable; validation is manual and specified by each task’s completion checklist.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
No Git history is available in this repository. If you use version control externally, use concise, descriptive commit messages (e.g., `Complete task-2.1 evidence tables`) and include a short summary of changes in any PR.

## Agent-Specific Instructions
- **Do not open `synthesis-notes/`** until Phase 2 tasks are complete (quarantine rule).
- Use only the novel and the task instructions as sources unless a task explicitly allows otherwise.
- Each task must include counter-evidence and address named counter-readings.
