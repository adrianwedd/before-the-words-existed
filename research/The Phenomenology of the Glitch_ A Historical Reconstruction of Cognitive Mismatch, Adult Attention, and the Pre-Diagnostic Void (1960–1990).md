# **The Phenomenology of the Glitch: A Historical Reconstruction of Cognitive Mismatch, Adult Attention, and the Pre-Diagnostic Void (1960–1990)**

## **1\. Introduction: The Nervous System in the Age of Information**

In 1984, the year William Gibson published *Neuromancer*, the cultural and clinical understanding of human attention was undergoing a tectonic shift that was largely invisible to the general public. While Gibson was encoding the experience of the "console cowboy"—a figure defined by a desperate need for high-speed stimuli, chemical regulation, and a hyper-focused interface with the digital void—psychiatry was struggling to find a name for the adult manifestation of these very traits. The protagonist of *Neuromancer*, Case, operates in a state of constant cognitive hunger, a phenomenology of "buzz" and "flatlining" that mirrors the lived experience of severe executive dysfunction. Yet, in the lexicon of 1984, Case would not be described as having a neurodevelopmental disorder. He would be called a "burnout," a "hustler," or perhaps a victim of "technostress."

This report provides a forensic reconstruction of the diagnostic, cultural, and technological vocabularies available between 1960 and 1990, with a granular focus on the 1980–1987 period. The objective is to delineate the "negative space" of adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) prior to its popular codification. By analyzing the transition from "Minimal Brain Dysfunction" to "Attention Deficit Disorder," the emerging psychology of human-computer interaction, and the sociopolitical controversies surrounding stimulant medication, we establish that the phenomenology of cognitive-environment mismatch existed culturally and experientially long before it possessed a stable clinical name.

The analysis reveals that in 1984, the adult experience of what is now termed ADHD was fragmented across disparaging clinical labels (e.g., "Residual Type"), emerging theories of technological adaptation (e.g., "Technostress," "Information Overload"), and subcultural identities (e.g., "Hackers"). This fragmentation suggests that the literature of the early cyberpunk era was not merely predicting a technological future, but documenting a psychological present—one where the "wired" brain found itself at odds with a linear world, seeking prosthetic environments (cyberspace) to correct a fundamental deficit in stimulation.

## **2\. The Clinical Construction of the "Deficit" (1960–1980)**

To understand the linguistic vacuum surrounding adult attention disorders in 1984, one must first trace the trajectory of the diagnosis from a suspicion of "damage" to a theory of "dysfunction." The vocabulary available to an educated layperson in the early 1980s was the sediment of a decades-long struggle to define "minimal" deviations in brain function that did not result in gross neurological impairment but wreaked havoc on behavioral regulation.

### **2.1 The Era of "Minimal Brain Dysfunction" (MBD)**

Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, the prevailing terminology for the cluster of symptoms involving distractibility, impulsivity, and motor restlessness was "Minimal Brain Dysfunction" (MBD) or the "Hyperkinetic Reaction of Childhood".1 The concept of MBD, codified in the early 1960s, served as a "wastebasket" diagnosis for children who exhibited behavioral and learning difficulties but lacked the "hard" neurological signs associated with cerebral palsy or severe brain trauma.2

The MBD label reflected a medical model that presumed a static, physiological defect—"damage"—rather than a variation in neurocognitive style. The diagnosis was inextricably linked to the idea of "soft signs," such as minor motor coordination issues or perceptual anomalies.2 Crucially, the disorder was viewed through a developmental lens that posited a "maturational lag." The prevailing clinical wisdom held that the nervous system matured during puberty, leading to the spontaneous remission of symptoms. Consequently, there was no clinical language to describe an adult with these traits; by definition, an adult could not have a "childhood reaction" or a "maturational lag" once they had matured.2

In the *DSM-II* (1968), the condition was officially termed "Hyperkinetic Reaction of Childhood." This nomenclature is significant for two reasons. First, it emphasized *kinesis* (movement) over *cognition* (attention). Second, the inclusion of "Childhood" in the title effectively quarantined the diagnosis to the pediatric population.5 An adult exhibiting similar symptoms in the 1970s—restlessness, inability to focus, impulsive decision-making—would likely be viewed through psychoanalytic frameworks (e.g., anxiety neurosis, character flaws) rather than a neurodevelopmental one.

### **2.2 The Cognitive Turn: Virginia Douglas and the Shift to Attention**

The pivot from "hyperactivity" to "attention"—a shift essential for the eventual recognition of the adult phenotype—occurred largely due to the work of Canadian psychologist Virginia Douglas in the 1970s. In her address to the Canadian Psychological Association in 1972, Douglas argued that the core deficit was not the excessive motor activity, which often diminished with age, but a failure in "sustained attention" and "impulse control".2

This theoretical shift was monumental. If the disorder was defined by *attention* rather than *movement*, it opened the logical possibility that the condition could persist into adulthood, even after the visible motor restlessness had subsided or internalized into a subjective sense of "nervous energy." Research by Douglas and others using continuous performance tests (CPT) demonstrated that these attentional deficits were cognitive, stable, and distinct from simple bad behavior.2

By the late 1970s, this "cognitive turn" had gained sufficient traction to influence the task force for the next edition of the DSM. The recognition that "attention" was the central mechanism allowed for a phenomenology that was less about disrupting a classroom and more about an internal discontinuity of thought—a "glitch" in the processing of reality that could theoretically affect a 30-year-old computer programmer as much as a 10-year-old student.

### **2.3 DSM-III (1980): The Birth of "ADD" and the "Residual" Adult**

In 1980, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) released the *DSM-III*, a watershed document that introduced the term "Attention Deficit Disorder" (ADD).1 This change officially recognized that a person could be dreamy, distracted, and disorganized without necessarily being hyperactive. The *DSM-III* created two primary subtypes:

1. **ADD with Hyperactivity** (314.01)  
2. **ADD without Hyperactivity** (314.00)

However, the most significant inclusion for the purposes of understanding the 1984 landscape was the creation of a third, largely overlooked category: **Attention Deficit Disorder, Residual Type** (314.80).7

The "Residual Type" was the specific clinical label available in 1984 for adults who continued to experience symptoms. However, the criteria for this diagnosis were retrospective, exclusionary, and inherently dismissive. The *DSM-III* text defined it as follows:

"A. The individual once met the criteria for Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity... B. Signs of hyperactivity are no longer present, but other signs of the illness have persisted to the present without periods of remission".7

This terminology is revealing of the era's mindset. "Residual" implies something left over, a trace element of a condition that *should* have disappeared. It suggests a fading pathology—a scar—rather than a persistent, active neurotype. Furthermore, the criteria explicitly required a history of *hyperactivity* (Criterion A), meaning that the dreamy, inattentive "ADD without Hyperactivity" type had no diagnostic home in adulthood under this framework.7 An adult who had always been "spaced out" but never disruptive was clinically invisible.

In 1984, therefore, an adult suffering from executive dysfunction would only be recognized by the medical establishment if they had been a visibly hyperactive child. The "Residual" label served as a bridge, but an imperfect one, often failing to capture the full phenomenology of adult cognitive disorganization, effectively creating a "diagnostic void" for the majority of sufferers.8

## **3\. The 1984 Diagnostic Landscape: The "Utah Criteria" and the Underground Diagnosis**

By 1984, the disconnect between the clinical definitions in the *DSM-III* and the lived reality of adult patients was becoming apparent to a small cadre of researchers. While the general psychiatric community viewed attention deficits as "kid stuff," specific research hubs were beginning to map the contours of the adult disorder.

### **3.1 Paul Wender and the "Utah Criteria"**

The most significant exception to the diagnostic blindness of the 1980s was the work of Dr. Paul Wender at the University of Utah. By the mid-1970s and continuing into the 1980s, Wender and his colleagues (including Fred Reimherr and David Wood) were actively researching and treating adults with what they termed "ADD, Residual Type" or "Adult ADD".11

Wender recognized that the *DSM-III* criteria for adults were insufficient because they focused too heavily on the absence of hyperactivity and failed to capture the emotional dysregulation that plagued adult patients. In response, he developed the **"Utah Criteria"** for diagnosing adults. These criteria, used primarily in research settings in the 1980s, offer a far richer description of the adult phenomenology than the DSM, and strikingly resemble the temperament of the "cyberpunk" anti-hero.12

The Utah Criteria required a retrospective childhood diagnosis, but for current adult status, they demanded both motor hyperactivity and attentional difficulties, *plus* at least two of the following affective symptoms:

1. **Affective Lability:** Mood swings, shifting from normal to depressed or excited in hours.  
2. **Hot Temper:** A "short fuse" or transient loss of control.  
3. **Emotional Overreactivity:** An inability to take stress in stride; reacting excessively to ordinary stressors.  
4. **Disorganization:** Inability to complete tasks; "chaotic" life management.  
5. **Impulsivity:** Poor impulse control in decision making.11

Wender’s criteria are crucial for analyzing 1984 literature because they explicitly link *attention* with *emotion* and *temper*. The "cowboy" archetype in Gibson’s fiction—impulsive, high-strung, emotionally volatile, yet capable of hyperfocus—aligns perfectly with Wender’s description of the adult ADD phenotype. Wender noted that problems in adults "wear a different cloak"; what was a playground fight in childhood transforms into marital conflict or occupational instability in adulthood.11 In 1984, this "emotional" component of ADHD was not part of the standard *DSM* definition, meaning that patients exhibiting these traits were often misdiagnosed with cyclothymia, bipolar disorder, or Borderline Personality Disorder.13

### **3.2 The Invisible Adult Patient in 1984**

Outside of the University of Utah and a few specialized clinics, the adult with ADD in 1984 was largely invisible to medicine. An educated layperson experiencing the "cognitive-environment mismatch" likely would not have used the term "ADD." Instead, they might have described themselves using characterological or moral language: "scatterbrained," "unmotivated," "impulsive," "nervous," or "eccentric." Without a robust diagnostic category, the phenomenology was internalized as a character flaw or a failure of will.11

The prevailing clinical opinion remained that ADD was a "relic of adolescence".4 Adults presenting with disorganization were often viewed as suffering from anxiety disorders (due to internal restlessness) or "masked depression." This misdiagnosis often led to treatment with sedatives or talk therapy, neither of which addressed the underlying executive dysfunction. The "Residual" diagnosis existed in the book, but it was rarely applied in the field, leaving the 1984 adult to navigate their cognitive glitches without a map.10

### **3.3 Pharmacological Interventions: The Frontier of "Chemical Management"**

In 1984, the treatment landscape for adults was experimental and fraught with stigma. While Ritalin (methylphenidate) was the standard of care for children, its use in adults was controversial and technically off-label. Wender’s studies in the late 1970s and early 1980s demonstrated that adults responded to stimulants (methylphenidate, pemoline) with the same "paradoxical" calming effect seen in children.4

However, many psychiatrists were hesitant to prescribe Schedule II narcotics to adults, fearing addiction and abuse. This created a situation where the most effective treatment for the condition was culturally coded as a street drug ("speed") rather than a medicine. Alternatives included Tricyclic Antidepressants (such as imipramine) and Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs), which affected the norepinephrine and dopamine systems but carried significant side effects.4

This pharmacological context is vital for understanding the 1984 zeitgeist: "chemical management" of the brain was a frontier science, hovering between legitimate psychiatry and the experimental self-medication found in subcultures. The character of Case in *Neuromancer*, whose nervous system is damaged by "mycotoxins" and who relies on "betaphenethylamine" to function, reflects this era's ambivalence about neurochemistry—a tool for enhancement and a source of dependency.

## **4\. Alternative Vocabularies of 1984: Technostress and the Computerized Mind**

While clinical psychiatry struggled to define adult attention deficits, the popular culture of 1984 was obsessed with the psychological impact of the "computer revolution." A key insight of this report is that the symptoms of "cognitive mismatch"—distractibility, overload, irritability—were often attributed to the *machine* rather than the *brain*. The vocabulary of computing provided a metaphor for the mind that competed with, and arguably superseded, the vocabulary of psychiatry.

### **4.1 Craig Brod and "Technostress" (1984)**

In 1984, psychologist Craig Brod published *Technostress: The Human Cost of the Computer Revolution*, a seminal text that introduced the term "technostress" to the popular lexicon.18 Brod defined technostress as "a modern disease of adaptation caused by an inability to cope with the new computer technologies in a healthy manner".18

Brod described two distinct forms of technostress, both of which mirror aspects of the ADHD phenomenology but frame them as environmental reactions:

1. **The Struggle to Accept:** Anxiety, irritability, and mental fatigue caused by information overload and the demand for machine-like perfection. This aligns with the "inattentive" or "overwhelmed" presentation of ADD.  
2. **Overidentification (The "Technocentered"):** This is the more "cyberpunk" manifestation. Brod described individuals (hackers, programmers) who "overidentified" with the computer, becoming less emotional, more factual, and impatient with the slowness and ambiguity of human interaction.18

The symptoms Brod listed for technostress—**difficulty concentrating, irritability, insomnia, mental fatigue, and a feeling of being "overwhelmed"** 18—are nearly identical to the symptoms of adult ADHD (or "ADD Residual Type"). In 1984, an adult experiencing executive dysfunction in a high-tech environment would likely be diagnosed by their peers not with ADD, but with "technostress." This framing externalized the disorder: the problem was not the brain's inherent structure, but the unnatural speed and volume of the data stream. It was a "disease of adaptation" to the future.19

### **4.2 Sherry Turkle and the "Holding Power" of the Machine**

Also published in 1984, Sherry Turkle’s *The Second Self: Computers and the Human Spirit* provided a psychological anthropology of the computer user. Turkle interviewed hackers, children, and engineers, identifying a phenomenon she called the "holding power" of the computer—its ability to induce a state of intense, trance-like focus.22

Turkle identified that for certain individuals, the computer offered a "rule-governed world" that was safer and more manageable than the messy social world. She described hackers as having a "mastery" over this domain, often at the expense of other life functions.24 This description aligns with the "hyperfocus" aspect of ADHD—a state where attention is not absent, but locked intensely onto a stimulating target.

In the context of 1984, Turkle’s work suggests that what might be clinically termed "attention deficit" in a classroom could become "high-performance focus" in front of a console. This "context-dependent" view of cognition anticipates the neurodiversity paradigm but was framed then as a "relationship with the machine" rather than a "neurotype." The "Hacker Ethic," documented by Steven Levy in *Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution* (also 1984), further validated this cognitive style, celebrating the obsessive, hyper-focused, anti-authoritarian traits that psychiatry might label as pathology.26

### **4.3 Information Overload and the "Cognitive Filter"**

The concept of "Information Overload," popularized by Alvin Toffler in *Future Shock* (1970), reached a fever pitch by the early 1980s. The psychological literature of the period 1980–1984 increasingly discussed the limits of human processing capacity.28 The discourse centered on the "cognitive filter." A failure to filter irrelevant stimuli was seen as a reaction to the *environment* (too much data) rather than a deficit of the *subject*.

For the person with undiagnosed ADD in 1984, this "overload" was a chronic, baseline state. The emerging "Information Society" was creating an environment that was hostile to the ADD neurotype (demanding sustained, linear attention) while simultaneously offering a seduction (the high-speed stimulation of the screen). This tension—between being overwhelmed by the world and addicted to the interface—is the precise phenomenological space occupied by Gibson's characters.

### **4.4 "Executive Burnout" and "Yuppie Flu"**

Parallel to the technological discourse, the corporate world of the early 1980s developed its own vocabulary for cognitive failure. "Executive Burnout" became a buzzword to describe high-functioning individuals who suddenly hit a wall of exhaustion, cynicism, and inefficacy.30 The symptoms—forgetfulness, inability to concentrate, emotional exhaustion—mimic untreated adult ADHD.

Similarly, the mid-1980s saw the emergence of "Yuppie Flu" (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome), a label often applied to young professionals experiencing unexplained fatigue and "brain fog".32 While distinct medical conditions, these cultural labels served as "holding pens" for adults experiencing cognitive and executive collapse in the absence of a recognized ADHD diagnosis. In 1984, if you couldn't work because you couldn't focus, you didn't have ADHD; you had "burnout."

## **5\. The Ritalin Wars and the Cultural Suppression of Diagnosis (1980–1987)**

The visibility of ADHD in the 1980s was inextricably linked to the controversy surrounding its treatment. The "Ritalin Wars" of the late 1980s played a significant role in shaping the public narrative, often suppressing the recognition of adult ADHD by framing the condition as a tool for social control of unruly children.

### **5.1 The Anti-Ritalin Backlash**

While stimulant use grew steadily in the early 1980s, a massive cultural backlash began around 1986–1987. This was fueled significantly by the Church of Scientology (via the Citizens Commission on Human Rights) and various consumer advocacy groups, who launched a "media blitz" against methylphenidate.34

Key media moments included:

* **The "Oprah Winfrey Show" (1987):** A seminal episode featuring "whistleblowers" and parents claiming Ritalin was "drugging children" into submission. This broadcast is widely cited as triggering a national panic and a temporary decline in Ritalin prescriptions.34  
* **Legal Battles:** Lawsuits in 1987–1988 alleged that schools were coercing parents to medicate children, framing ADHD not as a biological reality but as a conspiracy of compliance.34

### **5.2 Impact on the Adult Narrative**

This hostile climate made the concept of *adult* ADHD culturally radioactive. If the public narrative was that "doctors are inventing a disease to drug energetic boys," the idea that adults might also have this "disease" and need "speed" (Ritalin) was culturally untenable. It reinforced the idea that ADHD was a "myth" or a "disciplinary tool," obscuring the genuine cognitive suffering of adults.36

Consequently, in 1984, the adult user of stimulants (like the "betaphenethylamine" users in Gibson's fiction) was culturally coded as a "drug abuser" or a "speed freak," not a patient treating a neurochemical deficiency. The "medical" use of stimulants was strictly quarantined to childhood; crossing that line into adulthood moved one from the clinic to the street.

### **5.3 Mainstream Media Coverage**

Prior to 1987, mainstream press coverage of ADD was sparse and child-focused. The *New York Times* and *Time* magazine covered "hyperactivity" as a school issue. It was not until the mid-1990s (specifically a 1994 *Time* cover story titled "Life in Overdrive") that the media began to loudly proclaim, "It's not just kids who have it".38 In 1984, this "clarion call" had not yet sounded. Adults were left to navigate their symptoms in the dark.

## **6\. Disability Studies and the Pre-Neurodiversity Era**

To understand the theoretical framework available in 1984, one must look at the nascent field of Disability Studies. The modern concept of "neurodiversity"—the idea that brains are wired differently and that this is a valid form of human variation—did not exist. The term "neurodiversity" would not be coined until the late 1990s. However, the intellectual groundwork was being laid.

### **6.1 The Social Model of Disability**

The 1980s saw the formalization of the **Social Model of Disability**. Originating with the Union of the Physically Impaired Against Segregation (UPIAS) in 1976, this model was solidified by Mike Oliver in 1983\.40 The Social Model distinguished between:

* **Impairment:** The biological functional limitation.  
* **Disability:** The disadvantage caused by a contemporary social organization which takes no or little account of people who have impairments.41

In 1984, this model was primarily applied to physical disabilities. However, the *logic* of the Social Model—that the environment creates the disability—was latent in the discourse around "Technostress." When Craig Brod argued that humans were "struggling to adapt" to computer speed, he was essentially making a Social Model argument: the *environment* (the computer age) was disabling the *organism* (the human attention span).18

### **6.2 "Cognitive Style" vs. Pathology**

In the educational and psychological literature of the early 1980s, there was an interest in "cognitive styles." Howard Gardner’s *Frames of Mind* (1983) introduced the theory of Multiple Intelligences, which challenged the unitary view of IQ.43 While Gardner did not explicitly address ADHD, his work fostered a cultural readiness to accept that different brains process information differently.

In 1984, a person with ADHD traits might have been described as having a "divergent" or "creative" cognitive style, or conversely, as suffering from a "learning disability" (a term that gained federal recognition in the US in roughly 1975 under PL 94-142).2 The "LD" label was the closest non-medical bucket for cognitive variation, often overlapping with ADD in educational settings.

## **7\. The 1987 Shift: DSM-III-R and Terminology Consolidation**

The period of diagnostic ambiguity essentially ended—or rather, shifted shape—in 1987 with the publication of the *DSM-III-R*. This revision renamed the disorder **Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)**.1

While this change unified the terminology, it also had the effect of re-emphasizing "hyperactivity" as a central component, potentially marginalizing the "inattentive" type that *DSM-III* had attempted to carve out. The *DSM-III-R* undifferentiated the subtypes, creating a single polythetic list of symptoms. This meant that the "dreamy" adult without motor hyperactivity might actually have had a *harder* time getting a diagnosis in 1988 than in 1984, as the "without hyperactivity" label was removed (until being reinstated in *DSM-IV* in 1994).4

Thus, 1984 stands as a unique moment: a time when "Attention Deficit Disorder" (ADD) existed as a concept separate from hyperactivity, yet lacked the cultural and clinical infrastructure to support adults.

## **8\. Conclusion: The Phenomenology of the Pre-Diagnosed**

In 1984, the "mismatch" between the cognitive organism and the accelerating, information-dense environment was a palpable phenomenon without a unified name. The words "Attention Deficit Disorder" existed in the *DSM-III*, but they were tethered to childhood and "residual" states.

For the adult experiencing this mismatch—the inability to filter, the need for high-stimulation "flow" states to function, the emotional volatility—the available languages were fragmented. One could be a "technostress" victim, overwhelmed by the data stream; a "hacker," finding refuge in the "holding power" of the console; or a "residual" case, living in the shadow of a childhood pathology.

Table 1 summarizes the lexicon of the void in 1984:

| Domain | Terminology in 1984 | Implication/Connotation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **DSM-III (Clinical)** | *Attention Deficit Disorder, Residual Type* (314.80) | A leftover childhood pathology; a fading echo of disease. |
| **Research Psychology** | *Adult ADD* / *Minimal Brain Dysfunction* | A persistent neurochemical disorder of mood and attention (Wender). |
| **Workplace/Tech** | *Technostress* / *Information Overload* | An environmental assault; inability to cope with modernity. |
| **Subculture** | *Hacker* / *Computer Bum* | A distinct psychological type suited for machine interaction but socially inept. |
| **Self-Description** | *Scatterbrained*, *Nervous*, *Burned Out* | Moral failure or character flaw; "Type A" personality breakdown. |
| **Pharmacology** | *Speed*, *Uppers* (Street) vs. *Ritalin* (Kids) | Adult stimulant use viewed as illicit/recreational, not therapeutic. |

This research supports the argument that fiction from this era, such as *Neuromancer*, encodes this specific historical tension. The "console cowboy"—chemically regulated, hyper-focused, socially maladapted, and interfacing directly with the data stream—can be read as a manifestation of the **Adult ADD phenotype** seeking a prosthetic environment (cyberspace) where its deficits become assets. In the absence of a "neurodiversity" framework, the 1984 "mismatch" was framed as a struggle between the human nervous system and the machine age—a struggle that the "Residual" diagnosis was woefully ill-equipped to describe. The "words" for adult ADHD did not fully exist in the culture of 1984, but the *phenomenology*—the lived experience of the "buzz," the "glitch," and the "overload"—was everywhere, waiting for a syntax that was still a decade away.
