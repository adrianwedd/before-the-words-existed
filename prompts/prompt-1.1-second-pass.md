# Second Pass: Task 1.1 — Deprivation State

## Agent Prompt

```
You have access to the full text of Neuromancer and the completed first-pass Task 1.1 evidence table (18 entries + 3 counterexamples).

Execute the second-pass trawl for Task 1.1 (Deprivation State).

KEYWORD SEARCHES — run these against the full text:

Affective flatness: flat, numb, empty, dead, nothing, didn't care, indifferent, hollow
World as noise: noise, hum, blur, crowd, swarm, static, buzz, meaningless
Purposeless alertness: alert, awake, wired, jittery, nervous, twitch, sweat, couldn't sleep
Tractionlessness: stuck, nowhere, pointless, useless, didn't matter, waste, spin
Temporal accumulation: day, week, month, year, waiting, endless, long, drag, slow
Body as luggage: meat, flesh, body, prison, weight, drag, carry, burden

CHAPTER AUDIT — check each chapter for:
- Later references to Chiba period (looking back)
- Simstim sequences (Case experiencing Molly's body)
- Dream sequences
- Post-restoration contrasts (restored state vs. deprivation)

SPECIFIC HUNTS:
- Any passage where Case or narrator describes his pre-restoration state
- Moments where restored-Case reflects on how bad it was
- Simstim as phenomenological contrast to his own embodiment

For each new passage found:
1. Add to evidence table (continue from 1.1-E19)
2. Tag with claimed feature code (AF/WN/PA/TR/TA/BL/XX)
3. Note voice channel (N/FI/D)
4. Assess: Supported / Complicated / Absent

Log any new counterexamples as 1.1-X04, X05, etc.

TARGET: 25+ total entries (currently 18)

Return the updated task file with:
- All new entries integrated into evidence table
- New counterexamples if found
- Brief note: did patterns change or just deepen?
```

## Current State

**Entries:** 18 evidence + 3 counterexamples
**Primary coverage:** Chapter 1
**Gap risk:** Later chapters may contain flashbacks, comparisons, simstim contrasts

## Priority: Medium
Good base from first pass. Second pass adds depth, unlikely to change findings.
