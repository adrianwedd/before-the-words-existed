# Second Pass: Task 2.1 — Time Phenomenology

## Agent Prompt

```
You have access to the full text of Neuromancer and the completed first-pass Task 2.1 evidence table (15 entries).

Execute the second-pass trawl for Task 2.1 (Time Phenomenology).

KEYWORD SEARCHES — run these against the full text:

Explicit duration: hour, minute, second, day, week, month, year, time, long, short
Subjective duration: felt like, seemed, endless, forever, instant, suddenly, before I knew
Urgency/pressure: hurry, rush, deadline, quick, fast, now, wait, waiting
Flow/absorption: lost track, forgot, hours later, didn't notice, absorbed, deep
Future orientation: tomorrow, soon, later, will, going to, plan, next, after

CHAPTER AUDIT — check each chapter, noting Case's STATE for each temporal marker:
- DEP = Deprivation (pre-restoration)
- MEM = Remembering/anticipating Matrix
- RES = Just restored (first access)
- ACT = Active Matrix operation
- OUT = Outside Matrix but post-restoration
- TRN = Transition moment

CURRENT GAPS (prioritize these states):
- ACT: Currently 6 entries, target 10-15
- OUT: Currently 1 entry, target 5-8
- TRN: Currently 0 entries, target 3-5

SPECIFIC HUNTS:
- Straylight sequence (extended real-time action)
- Freeside chapters (mixed meat/Matrix)
- Operation planning (deadlines, countdowns)
- Simstim switches (temporal experience when switching perspectives)
- Any timestamp or clock reference

For each new passage found:
1. Add to evidence table (continue from 2.1-E16)
2. Tag state code (DEP/MEM/RES/ACT/OUT/TRN)
3. Tag time quality (Stretching/Compressing/Accumulating/Flowing/Absent/Fragmented)
4. Note voice channel (N/FI/D)

TARGET: 25+ total entries (currently 15)

Return the updated task file with:
- All new entries integrated into evidence table
- State-time correlation table updated
- Brief note: did patterns change or just deepen?

## Current State

**Entries:** 15 temporal markers
**State coverage:** DEP (5), MEM (1), RES (2), ACT (6), OUT (1), TRN (0)
**Gap risk:** ACT and OUT states underrepresented; TRN missing entirely

## Priority: High
Good first pass but significant gaps in post-restoration states.
