# Second Pass: Task 2.3 — Environmental Markers

## Agent Prompt

```
You have access to the full text of Neuromancer and the completed first-pass Task 2.3 evidence table (9 entries, 4-environment affordance map).

Execute the second-pass trawl for Task 2.3 (Environmental Markers).

KEYWORD SEARCHES — run these against the full text:

Attribution language: broken, damaged, wrong, fault, couldn't, unable, failed, lost, blocked, denied, locked, cut off, severed
Access language: access, interface, jack, connect, reach, enter, open, available
Environment descriptors: place, space, world, city, street, room, matrix, meat, flesh
Fit/mismatch language: fit, belong, home, country, foreign, alien, wrong place, right place

ENVIRONMENT AUDIT — current affordance map has only 4 environments. Expand to include:

| Environment | Check for | Currently mapped? |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Chiba City | ✓ | Yes — expand |
| Night City (general) | Distinct from Chiba? | No |
| Chatsubo bar | What it affords Case | No |
| Coffin hotel | Claustrophobia, storage | No |
| Matrix (general) | ✓ | Yes — expand |
| Matrix (Sense/Net) | Specific run | No |
| Matrix (Rio) | Specific location | No |
| Matrix (Straylight) | Final run | No |
| Freeside | Leisure/waiting/mismatch | No |
| Straylight Villa | Physical infiltration | No |
| The Finn's | Information/tools | No |
| BAMA sprawl | Home territory? | No |
| Simstim (Molly's body) | Being in another's body | No |
| Construct space (beach) | Neuromancer's world | No |

SPECIFIC HUNTS:
- Every named location — what does it afford/deny Case?
- Simstim as environment — being in Molly's body is distinct
- Construct space — the beach, Neuromancer's realm
- Transition moments — jacking in/out, what changes?
- Passages attributing dysfunction to person vs. environment vs. fit

For each new passage found:
1. Add to attribution evidence table (continue from 2.3-E10)
2. Tag attribution type (Internal/External/Interactional)
3. Note who attributes (narrator, character, institution)
4. Note voice channel (N/FI/D)

For each new environment:
1. Add to affordance map
2. Note what it affords Case
3. Note what it fails to afford
4. Key passage reference

TARGET: 18+ total entries (currently 9), 10+ environments mapped (currently 4)

Return the updated task file with:
- All new entries integrated into attribution table
- Expanded affordance map
- Brief note: did patterns change or just deepen?
```

## Current State

**Entries:** 9 attribution entries
**Affordance map:** 4 environments (Chiba, Matrix memory, Matrix restored, Physical world)
**Gap risk:** HIGH — novel has 12+ distinct environments not yet catalogued

## Priority: High
Affordance map is thin. Expanding it strengthens the interactional-model argument.
