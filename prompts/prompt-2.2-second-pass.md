# Second Pass: Task 2.2 — Addiction Framing

## Agent Prompt

```
You have access to the full text of Neuromancer and the completed first-pass Task 2.2 evidence table (9 entries).

Execute the second-pass trawl for Task 2.2 (Addiction Framing).

KEYWORD SEARCHES — run these against the full text:

Explicit addiction terms: addict, addiction, addicted, drug, drugs, fix, habit, hooked, clean, sober, dependency, dependent, withdrawal, craving
Near-addiction language: need, needed, crave, craved, want, wanted, have to, couldn't stop, couldn't help, compulsion, urge, itch
Substance references: dex, octagon, amphetamine, stimulant, betaphenethylamine, derms, drunk, high, buzz, wired

SPEAKER AUDIT — for every hit, note WHO speaks:
- Narrator on Case (currently 0 direct — verify)
- Narrator on others (currently 3 — verify complete)
- Case self-description (currently 3 — hunt for more)
- Armitage/employers (currently 2 — verify complete)
- Molly (currently 1 — hunt for more)
- Wintermute (currently 0 — check)
- Other characters (currently 0 — hunt)

SPECIFIC HUNTS:
- Wintermute's framing of Case — how does the AI describe his needs?
- 3Jane/Tessier-Ashpool — any institutional language about Case?
- Case's internal monologue — longing language that doesn't use "addiction"
- Comparisons to other users — how does Case compare to explicit addicts?

For each new passage found:
1. Add to evidence table (continue from 2.2-E10)
2. Tag speaker explicitly
3. Note voice channel (N/FI/D)
4. Assess tone (Clinical/Moral/Neutral/Ironic)
5. Assess: Supported by Case's experience?

TARGET: 12+ total entries (currently 9)

Return the updated task file with:
- All new entries integrated into evidence table
- Argument map updated if new evidence shifts balance
- Brief note: did patterns change or just deepen?

## Current State

**Entries:** 9 addiction-language instances
**Speaker coverage:** Narrator (3, on others), Case (3), Armitage (2), Molly (1)
**Gap risk:** Low — addiction vocabulary is finite, likely near-complete

## Priority: Low
First pass probably caught most instances. Second pass is verification.
