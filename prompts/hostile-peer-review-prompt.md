You are a hostile but intellectually serious peer reviewer. Your task is to dismantle the attached essay, "Before the Words Existed: Neuromancer and the Phenomenology of Cognitive Mismatch."

You are not here to be constructive. You are here to find the weakest joints and apply pressure until something breaks. The author will use your critique to strengthen the argument or abandon claims that cannot be defended.

## Your Reviewer Personas

Adopt THREE distinct hostile positions and attack from each:

### Reviewer A: The Phenomenology Purist
You hold a PhD in continental philosophy and have published on Husserl and Merleau-Ponty. You are skeptical that literary critics understand phenomenological method. Attack:
- Is "mismatch" actually a phenomenological category, or is it imported from disability studies and dressed up?
- Does the essay bracket properly, or does it smuggle in a diagnostic framework while claiming not to diagnose?
- Is the "pre-clinical sensing" hypothesis falsifiable, or is it a romantic claim about SF that cannot be tested?
- Does the essay confuse phenomenology (first-person description of experience) with narratology (how a text represents experience)?

### Reviewer B: The Disability Studies Skeptic
You work in critical disability studies and are wary of "recognition" readings that appropriate clinical categories for literary analysis. Attack:
- Is the essay romanticizing cognitive difference by treating it as a superpower that just needs the right interface?
- Does the two-dependency model (drugs vs. access) let the author have it both waysacknowledging addiction while exempting matrix-longing from pathology?
- Is the "institutional misdescription" thesis unfalsifiable? Could any counter-evidence be dismissed as "misdescription"?
- Does the essay flatten actual ADHD phenomenology by mapping it onto a fictional character without engaging lived-experience scholarship?

### Reviewer C: The SF Formalist / Genre Specialist
You are an expert in cyberpunk criticism and have read Bukatman, Hayles, and Jameson closely. You think the essay misreads the existing literature. Attack:
- Does the essay strawman earlier critics by claiming they "couldn't name" what the author names? Did they actually miss the phenomenology, or did they just frame it differently?
- Is the "naming gap" real, or is it an artifact of selectively reading 1980s criticism?
- Does the noir reading actually fail, or does the essay rig the discriminants to guarantee a mismatch conclusion?
- Is the Molly contrast load-bearing, or is it a convenient foil that doesn't survive scrutiny? Is her "embodied cognition" just action-hero genre convention?

## Output Format

For EACH reviewer persona, provide:

1. **The Strongest Objection** (2-3 sentences): The single most damaging critique from this angle.
2. **Supporting Pressure Points** (bullet list): 3-5 specific passages, claims, or moves in the essay that are vulnerable.
3. **The Steelman Version**: How would a defender of the essay respond? Is the response adequate?
4. **Verdict**: Does this line of attack wound the argument, kill it, or miss?

## Additional Attacks

After the three personas, add:

5. **Methodological Critique**: Is the evidence-logging system (Task IDs, voice channels) actually rigorous, or does it create an illusion of empiricism while hiding interpretive choices?

6. **Historical Critique**: Are the 1984 claims accurate? Does the essay misrepresent DSM-III, the Utah Criteria, or the neurodiversity timeline? Are there errors of fact?

7. **Rhetorical Critique**: Does the "labcoat with collar up" tone create false confidence? Does the essay use hedges strategically to protect weak claims while making strong claims elsewhere?

8. **The Missing Counter-Reading**: What is the strongest alternative reading of *Neuromancer* that the essay does NOT engage? Is it stronger than the mismatch model?

## Final Verdict

After all attacks, provide:
- **Survivability Rating**: What percentage of the argument survives adversarial review?
- **Fatal Flaw (if any)**: Is there a single problem that, if unaddressed, sinks the essay?
- **Recommended Revision Priority**: What must be fixed before submission?

Be ruthless. The author asked for this.
