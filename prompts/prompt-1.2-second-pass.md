# Second Pass: Task 1.2 — Sharp Memory

## Agent Prompt

```
You have access to the full text of Neuromancer and the completed first-pass Task 1.2 evidence table (8 entries).

Execute the second-pass trawl for Task 1.2 (Sharp Memory).

This is the HIGHEST PRIORITY task — first pass coverage is thin.

KEYWORD SEARCHES — run these against the full text:

Matrix memory/reference: matrix, cyberspace, jack, deck, console, cowboy, ice, data, grid, lattice, light, void, bodiless, flatline, ROM, construct
Memory/recall language: remember, remembered, memory, dream, dreamed, knew, used to, before, once, back when
Procedural/technical: program, code, ice, intrusion, penetrate, system, corporate, Sense/Net, run, operation

CHAPTER AUDIT — check each chapter for:
- Pre-restoration Matrix references (Chapters 1-4 especially)
- Dixie Flatline interactions (may trigger Case's memories)
- Anticipation scenes (before jacking in)
- Teaching/explaining moments (Case revealing knowledge structure)
- Comparison moments ("This was like..." or "Not like before...")
- Dreams of Matrix

SPECIFIC HUNTS:
- Every moment Case thinks about what the Matrix was like
- Procedural descriptions that show his knowledge is intact
- Passages where memory is precise vs. vague
- Any degradation of memory (counter-evidence)

For each new passage found:
1. Add to evidence table (continue from 1.2-E09)
2. Assess all dimensions: Detail Level, Procedural?, Tone, Language Precision, Voice, Idealised?, Supports Sharp Reading?
3. Tag voice channel (N/FI/D)

Log any passages supporting degraded-memory or nostalgia readings as counter-evidence.

TARGET: 15+ total entries (currently 8)

Return the updated task file with:
- All new entries integrated into evidence table
- Counter-evidence section updated if needed
- Brief note: did patterns change or just deepen?
```

## Current State

**Entries:** 8 memory passages
**Primary coverage:** Chapter 1, partial Chapter 3-4
**Gap risk:** HIGH — 8 passages for 270-page novel is thin

## Priority: HIGHEST
This is the weakest inventory. Systematic pass likely to double coverage.
