# Research Task 2.3: Environmental Markers

## Phase 2 | Evidence Gathering | Priority: High

---

## Critical Warning: This Is the Most Vulnerable Task

This task is where critics will aim hardest. Not because it's weak—but because the claim is susceptible to ideological attack.

The risk is making this move too absolutely:
> "When access is restored, Case doesn't change—his environment does."

That claim is directionally right but dangerous if not carefully hedged. The text *does* use damage language at times. Flattening that out invites accusations of:
- Minimising impairment
- Romanticising dependency
- Importing disability studies ideology without textual warrant

**The defensible formulation:**
> "The novel repeatedly oscillates between medical and interactional framings—but its *functional logic* resolves in favour of access, not cure."

This task must gather evidence for both framings and determine where the weight falls—without pretending the medical framing is absent.

---

## Objective

Determine whether *Neuromancer* locates Case's dysfunction internally (broken brain), externally (hostile environment), or interactionally (mismatch between cognitive style and available conditions).

The hypothesis:
- Case's suffering is better explained by environmental mismatch than by intrinsic deficit
- The text frames "treatment" as restoring access, not fixing Case
- When access is restored, Case doesn't change—his environment does
- This supports a social/interactional model of disability over a medical model

**This task gathers evidence for Section 4 of the essay.**

---

## Scope

**Primary text:** Entire novel, focusing on:
- Passages attributing Case's difficulty to internal vs. external factors
- The neural damage backstory (what was done, why, by whom)
- Restoration and its aftermath (what changes)
- Environmental descriptions (what affords, what blocks)

**Theoretical orientation:** Ecological psychology, disability studies (social vs. medical model), interface theory

---

## Key Concepts

### Three Models of Dysfunction

| Model | Where Dysfunction Lives | "Treatment" Means | Text Evidence Would Show |
|-------|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Medical/Internal | In the individual (broken brain/body) | Fixing the person | Case described as defective, damaged, ill |
| Social/External | In the environment (hostile, excluding) | Changing the environment | Environment described as blocking, denying, excluding |
| Interactional/Mismatch | In the fit between person and environment | Restoring access/interface | Emphasis on fit, match, access; neither person nor environment alone is "wrong" |

### Affordances and Access

From ecological psychology: environments offer "affordances"—possibilities for action that depend on the match between organism and environment. A ladder affords climbing *to a climber*. The same ladder doesn't afford climbing to someone in a wheelchair.

Question for *Neuromancer*: Does Night City / the non-Matrix world fail to afford Case anything? Does the Matrix afford him something the world doesn't?

---

## Method

### Step 1: Attribution Inventory

Locate every passage where Case's difficulty or suffering is attributed to a cause. Categorise:

| Attribution Type | Markers to Look For |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Internal | "He was broken," "his damaged nerves," "he couldn't," defect language |
| External | "They did this to him," "the system refused," "access denied," exclusion language |
| Interactional | "He didn't fit," "the interface was wrong," mismatch language |

### Step 2: "Treatment" Analysis

Examine how restoration is framed:

- Is Case "fixed" or is access "restored"?
- Does the text describe repairing *him* or repairing *his interface*?
- After restoration, is he different—or just differently situated?

### Step 3: Environmental Affordance Mapping

Track what environments afford or fail to afford Case:

| Environment | Affords | Fails to Afford | Evidence |
|-------------|---------|-----------------|----------|
| Chiba City / Night City | | | |
| The Matrix | | | |
| Molly's world (physical action) | | | |
| Institutional spaces | | | |

### Step 4: The "If Environment Changed" Test

Ask: If the Matrix were freely accessible, would Case be "disordered"?

Look for textual evidence that:
- His capacity is intact but blocked
- His difficulty disappears when conditions change
- The problem is access, not ability

---

## Evidence Logging System

**Evidence IDs:** Use format `2.3-E01`, `2.3-E02`, etc.

**Voice Channel:** Tag each entry:
- **N** = Narrator | **FI** = Free indirect discourse | **D** = Dialogue

**Critical for this task:** Attribution language from N carries more weight than D. If only characters call Case "damaged" but the narrator frames it as "access denied," that pattern matters.

## Evidence Table: Attribution of Dysfunction

| ID | Location | What's Attributed | Attribution Type (Int/Ext/Interact) | Who Attributes | Voice (N/FI/D) | Quote/Paraphrase | Notes |
|----|----------|------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|------------------|-------|
| 2.3-E01 | | | | | | | |
| 2.3-E02 | | | | | | | |
| [Add rows as needed] | | | | | | | |

## Evidence Table: The Punishment/Damage

| Aspect | Evidence | Implication |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| What was done to Case | | |
| Who did it | | |
| Why (stated reason) | | |
| How it's described (medical? punitive? both?) | | |
| What it removed (access? ability? both?) | | |

---

## Evidence Table: The Restoration

| Aspect | Evidence | Implication |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| What was restored | | |
| Who restored it | | |
| How it's described (healing? reconnection? both?) | | |
| What changes in Case | | |
| What changes in his access | | |
| Is he "different" after, or "himself again"? | | |

---

## Evidence Table: Environmental Affordances

| Environment | What It Affords (to Case) | What It Fails to Afford | Key Passage | Notes |
|-------------|--------------------------|------------------------|-------------|-------|
| Chiba City (deprivation) | | | | |
| Matrix (memory) | | | | |
| Matrix (restored access) | | | | |
| Physical world (Molly's domain) | | | | |
| [Add as needed] | | | | |

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **Is the neural damage framed as making Case "broken" or as removing his access to something he'd otherwise use?**
   - Medical framing: he's defective now
   - Access framing: he's locked out now
   - Look for: language of damage vs. language of severance

2. **When access is restored, does Case change—or does only his environment change?**
   - If Case changes: supports internal model
   - If only access changes: supports external/interactional model
   - Critical test: is restored-Case different from pre-damage-Case?

3. **Does the text support a social-model reading (disability as relational)?**
   - Look for: emphasis on what the environment denies
   - Look for: the "problem" located between Case and world, not in Case alone
   - Compare: how does the text frame other characters' limitations?

4. **What does the Matrix afford that meatspace doesn't?**
   - Not just "what can he do there" but "what mode of being is available"
   - Connect to Tasks 1.1, 1.2: coherence, traction, temporal structure

5. **Could a different environment (not Matrix, but different meatspace) work for Case?**
   - Or is the Matrix uniquely suited?
   - This tests whether it's *any* mismatch or a *specific* mismatch

---

## Counter-Reading to Engage

**The internal-deficit reading:** Case really is broken. The Matrix is a crutch. His inability to function without it is genuine disability, and framing it as "mismatch" minimises his damage.

To address this:
- Acknowledge: the neural damage is real, not imagined
- Distinguish: damage to *interface capacity* vs. damage to *personhood*
- Show: where the text emphasises access over essence
- Concede: where the text does frame Case as damaged/diminished

---

## Disability Studies Frame (Light Touch)

For Track B, you don't need heavy citation. But the conceptual frame helps:

| Model | Key Claim | Relevant to Neuromancer? |
|-------|-----------|-------------------------|
| Medical model | Disability is in the body; treatment fixes the body | Test: does the text treat Case as needing to be "fixed"? |
| Social model | Disability is in society's failure to accommodate; treatment changes society | Test: does the text treat environment/access as the problem? |
| Interaction model | Disability is in the mismatch; treatment improves fit | Test: does the text frame Case's situation as about fit? |

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Attribution Inventory
All passages attributing dysfunction, categorised by type.

### 2. Punishment Analysis
What was done, why, how it's framed.

### 3. Restoration Analysis
What was restored, how it's framed, what changed.

### 4. Affordance Map
What different environments afford or deny Case.

### 5. Model Assessment (300-400 words)
Which model (medical, social, interactional) does the text best support? With what qualifications?

### 6. Counter-Reading Response
Where does the internal-deficit reading have merit? Where does it fail?

### 7. Implications for Section 4 Draft
- What claims are supportable
- What qualifications are needed
- Which passages are load-bearing
- How to present the frame without jargon-heavy disability studies language

---

## Quality Standards

- **Distinguish** what characters say from what the narrator asserts
- **Track all attributions**, not just those supporting mismatch reading
- **Test the medical model** as seriously as the alternatives
- **Note ambiguities** where the text doesn't resolve cleanly
- **Avoid importing** disability studies jargon that isn't in the text
- **Connect to previous tasks** (deprivation state, memory, time) for coherence
